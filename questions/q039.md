## Notes
A) "A temporary working generation is stored on disk but removed afterwards" is correct.

Online compaction requires double space because:
1. Original repository data remains active
2. Temporary working copy created during compaction
3. Working copy deleted once compaction completes
4. Space returns to normal after process

Other options are incorrect:
- B) Cache wouldn't double repository size
- C) No backup generation is kept
- D) Incorrect about cleaning process

This temporary space requirement is why adequate free disk space is needed for online compaction.
