## Question
The AEM site has a large number of DAM assets. Users report that searching for assets through Asset Search in AEM is making AEM incredibly slow and sometimes even bringing the instance down. To solve this problem, the DevOps Engineer requires the index to be updated.
Which steps are required to index the DAM nodes with minimal interruptions to the users?

## Options
A) In CRXDE, open the node: /content/dam/collections and set the reindex property to "true"  <br /> 
B) In CRXDE, open the node: /oak:index/damAssetLucene and set the reindex property to "true" <br /> 
C) In CRXDE, open the node: /oak:index/workflowDataLucene and set the reindex property to "true" <br /> 
D) Take the AEM instance offline and run oak-run.jar to reindex the TarMK  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
D) Take the AEM instance offline and run oak-run.jar to reindex the TarMK  <br /> 

## Explanation
/content/dam/collections reindex (A)

Only reindexes collections in DAM
Very limited scope
Not a proper way to reindex
Incorrect approach
That location doesn't control indexing


/oak:index/damAssetLucene reindex (B)

Triggers reindexing of all DAM assets
Online reindexing
Can severely impact system performance
Use when only asset search is affected


/oak:index/workflowDataLucene reindex (C)

Correct path syntax (/oak:index)
Only affects workflow indexes
Online reindexing
Can impact performance
Limited to workflow data


oak-run.jar offline reindex (D)

Full offline reindexing
Most comprehensive approach
Requires system downtime
Fastest reindex method
Can reindex everything

Key Differences:
CopyOnline (A,B,C)           vs     Offline (D)
- System stays up              - Requires downtime
- Slower                      - Faster
- More resource intensive     - More efficient
- Can impact performance      - No user impact
- Limited scope              - Complete reindex
Also important:

Path syntax matters (/oak:index vs /oakindex)
Different indexes for different purposes (assets vs workflows)
Offline reindexing is generally preferred for large changes
Online reindexing can severely impact performance

## Notes
Why NOT option B (online reindexing damAssetLucene):

Already having performance issues
Online reindexing is very resource-intensive
Could make existing performance problems worse
Might crash the system during reindex
"Users report... making AEM incredibly slow"

Why option D (offline reindexing) is better:

Can be done during maintenance window
Much faster execution
No risk of crashing live system
More efficient processing
"minimal interruptions to users" - planned downtime is better than unpredictable crashes


Think of it like:

Online reindex = Fixing a car while driving it
Offline reindex = Taking car to garage during weekend

The question's key phrase "minimal interruptions" might seem to suggest online reindexing, but planned offline maintenance is actually less disruptive than:

Unpredictable crashes
Severe performance issues
Extended periods of slow response
Potential for incomplete indexing

Best practice for large DAM reindexing is to use oak-run.jar during planned maintenance.
