## Question
How should a DevOps engineer configure against Cross Site Request Forging attacks?

## Options
A) Send the proper X-Frame-Options HTTP response headers that instruct the browser to disallow framing from other domains  <br /> 
B) Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to wildcard  <br /> 
C) Create a filter to allow /libs/granite/csrf/token.json path and CSRF-Token header in dispatcher  <br /> 
D) [Option text]  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Create a filter to allow /libs/granite/csrf/token.json path and CSRF-Token header in dispatcher 

## Explanation
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a website where they are authenticated.

AEM has built-in CSRF protection, which relies on CSRF tokens to verify that a request is legitimate. These tokens are obtained from:
üîπ /libs/granite/csrf/token.json ‚Äì AEM generates CSRF tokens here.
üîπ CSRF-Token header ‚Äì This must be allowed in requests for validation.

Why is C correct?
‚úîÔ∏è Allowing /libs/granite/csrf/token.json ensures that AEM can issue CSRF tokens to authenticated users.
‚úîÔ∏è Allowing the CSRF-Token header ensures requests include the token for validation.
‚úîÔ∏è This approach aligns with Adobe's best practices for CSRF protection.

Why not the other options?
‚ùå A) Send the proper X-Frame-Options HTTP response headers that instruct the browser to disallow framing from other domains

Incorrect because X-Frame-Options protects against Clickjacking attacks, not CSRF.
‚ùå B) Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to wildcard (*)

Incorrect because a wildcard (*) in CORS headers allows requests from any domain, making CSRF worse instead of protecting against it.
‚ùå D) (Missing or incorrect option text)

If D was something related to blocking GET/POST requests without CSRF tokens, it might be valid, but C is the best answer based on AEM‚Äôs security model.
