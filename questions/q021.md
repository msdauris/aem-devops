## Question
[Question text goes here]

## Options
A) CQ-Handle: ResourceOnly  <br /> 
B) CQ-Action: Resource  <br /> 
C) CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly  <br /> 
D) CQ-Action-Scope: Resource  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly 

## Explanation
CQ-Handle: ResourceOnly

Not a valid header
Incorrect syntax
Doesn't exist in AEM


CQ-Action: Resource

Not a valid header
Incorrect format
Doesn't exist in AEM


CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly

Valid header
Replicates only the specific resource
Doesn't include children/subnodes

## Notes
The main differences:
CopyResourceOnly:                vs     Deep:
- Just the specified node          - Includes all children
- No child nodes                   - Full subtree replication
- Faster                          - More comprehensive
- Less resource intensive         - More resource intensive
The only valid option here is C (CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly)

Proper header name
Correct value
Used to control replication scope
Tells AEM to replicate just the resource itself

The scenario asks about:

Flushing specific resource (JSON data)
Without affecting other cache
Targeted invalidation
Preserving rest of cache


Why CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly is perfect:

Only flushes specified resource
Doesn't touch child resources
Doesn't invalidate entire cache
Precise control over what's flushed

CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly
- Flushes: /content/mysite/data.json
- Keeps: /content/mysite/data/*
- Keeps: /content/mysite/*
