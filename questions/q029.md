## Question
A business needs to remove a publish instance due to a contractual downsizing.
Which action will prevent a rapid increase of errors in the author instance?

## Options
A) Configure the dispatcher mapped to the publish instance being removed to display a maintenance page  <br /> 
B) Delete the replication agent on the author instance mapped to the publish instance being removed <br /> 
C) Remove the dispatchers associated with the publish instance being removed  <br /> 
D) Arrange a content freeze preventing access to the author instance while the publish instance is being removed  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Delete the replication agent on the author instance mapped to the publish instance being removed

## Explanation
Deleting the replication agent prevents failed replication attempts that would otherwise cause error logs to rapidly accumulate in the author instance. Without removing the agent, the author would continually try to replicate to a publish instance that no longer exists.

## Notes
These are steps for removing a publish instance. Let's analyze each option:

Configure dispatcher maintenance page (A)

Ensures users see maintenance message
Prevents error pages during removal
Good user experience practice


Delete replication agent (B)

Prevents failed replication attempts
Cleans up author configuration
Important for system hygiene


Remove associated dispatchers (C)

Unnecessary step
Dispatchers can be remapped
Too extreme solution


Content freeze on author (D)

Unnecessarily restrictive
Authors can still work
Publish removal doesn't require author lockdown

Best practices:

Configure maintenance page first
Delete replication agent
Keep dispatchers (can be reconfigured)
Allow author work to continue
