## Question
A DevOps Engineer must configure a production deployment pipeline. The AEM environment consists of one author instance, two publish instances, and two dispatcher instances. A load balancer and CDN are also leveraged.
In combination with load balancing, which step is required to make sure that the site is available during deployment?

## Options
A) Point the CDN to the author instance during the publish instance deployment <br /> 
B) Perform the deployment on one publish instance at a time <br /> 
C) Disable the replication agents during the deployment <br /> 
D) Clear the CDN cache after the author instance deployment <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Perform the deployment on one publish instance at a time 

## Explanation
B) "Perform the deployment on one publish instance at a time" is correct because:

With load balancing and rolling deployment:
- Traffic routes to available publish instance while other updates
- No service interruption
- Maintains site availability
- Updates complete without downtime

Other options fail because:
- A) Pointing CDN to author exposes admin interface
- C) Disabling replication stops content updates
- D) Clearing CDN cache after author deployment doesn't help availability

The key is maintaining service through sequential updates while load balancer handles traffic distribution.

## Notes
These are deployment strategies for publish instances:

B) Deploy one publish instance at a time
- Maintains service availability
- Rolling deployment approach
- Safest method
- Industry best practice

Other approaches are problematic:
```
A) CDN to author
- Exposes author instance
- Security risk
- Not for public access

C) Disable replication
- Causes content lag
- Unnecessary step
- Content sync issues

D) Clear CDN after author
- Wrong timing
- Author not public-facing
- Ineffective approach
```

Best practice is rolling deployment (B) to maintain service while updating.
