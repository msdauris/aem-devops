## Question
A DevOps Engineer is executing an online backup and wants to ensure consistency. This is a newer AEM version that uses Oak as a repository with multiversion concurrency control.
What setting is no longer required to be set before performing a backup to ensure consistency?

## Options
A) Blocking the replication queues  <br /> 
B) Blocking the repository writes  <br /> 
C) Blocking the repository reads  <br /> 
D) Blocking the repository queues  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Blocking the repository writes

## Explanation
Blocking the replication queues

Stops content from being published
Authors can still make changes
Changes queue up but don't go to publish
Used during publish maintenance


Blocking repository writes

Prevents any content changes
No one can edit/create/delete content
Read operations still work
Used during certain maintenance tasks


Blocking repository reads

Prevents content from being retrieved
Can't view pages or assets
Most severe form of blocking
Rarely used as it makes system unusable


Blocking repository queues

Not a standard AEM term
Could be confused with replication queues
This isn't a real option
Incorrect terminology

Key differences:
Replication queue blocking: Affects author â†’ publish flow
Write blocking: Affects content creation/editing
Read blocking: Affects content viewing
Repository queues: Not a valid concept

The choice depends on what you're trying to achieve:
Publish maintenance: Block replication queues
System maintenance: Block writes
Full maintenance: Block reads (rare)

## Notes
In previous versions of AEM, the setting that needed to be configured before backup to ensure consistency was Blocking repository writes.
This was required because:

Blocking writes would prevent any content changes during backup
This ensured a consistent state of the repository
It prevented data corruption during the backup process

However, this is no longer required in modern versions of AEM because:

Online backup capabilities have improved
The system can maintain consistency without blocking writes
Modern backup procedures can handle ongoing writes
Tar storage format (tar mk) includes mechanisms for consistent backups

This change made backups less disruptive since you no longer need to put the system in a read-only state during the backup process.
