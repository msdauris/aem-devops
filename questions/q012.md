## Question
A DevOps Engineer is executing an online backup and wants to ensure consistency. This is a newer AEM version that uses Oak as a repository with multiversion concurrency control.
What setting is no longer required to be set before performing a backup to ensure consistency?

## Options
A) Blocking the replication queues  <br /> 
B) Blocking the repository writes  <br /> 
C) Blocking the repository reads  <br /> 
D) Blocking the repository queues  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Blocking the repository writes

## Explanation
Blocking the replication queues

Stops content from being published  <br /> 
Authors can still make changes  <br /> 
Changes queue up but don't go to publish  <br /> 
Used during publish maintenance  <br /> 


Blocking repository writes

Prevents any content changes  <br /> 
No one can edit/create/delete content  <br /> 
Read operations still work  <br /> 
Used during certain maintenance tasks  <br /> 


Blocking repository reads

Prevents content from being retrieved  <br /> 
Can't view pages or assets  <br /> 
Most severe form of blocking  <br /> 
Rarely used as it makes system unusable  <br /> 


Blocking repository queues

Not a standard AEM term  <br /> 
Could be confused with replication queues  <br /> 
This isn't a real option  <br /> 
Incorrect terminology  <br /> 

Key differences:
Replication queue blocking: Affects author â†’ publish flow  <br /> 
Write blocking: Affects content creation/editing  <br /> 
Read blocking: Affects content viewing  <br /> 
Repository queues: Not a valid concept  <br /> 

The choice depends on what you're trying to achieve:
Publish maintenance: Block replication queues
System maintenance: Block writes
Full maintenance: Block reads (rare)

## Notes
In previous versions of AEM, the setting that needed to be configured before backup to ensure consistency was Blocking repository writes.
This was required because:

Blocking writes would prevent any content changes during backup  <br /> 
This ensured a consistent state of the repository  <br /> 
It prevented data corruption during the backup process  <br /> 

However, this is no longer required in modern versions of AEM because:

Online backup capabilities have improved  <br /> 
The system can maintain consistency without blocking writes  <br /> 
Modern backup procedures can handle ongoing writes  <br /> 
Tar storage format (tar mk) includes mechanisms for consistent backups  <br /> 

This change made backups less disruptive since you no longer need to put the system in a read-only state during the backup process.
