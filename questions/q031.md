## Notes
/system/* (A)

Broadest pattern
Blocks all system paths
Most restrictive
Includes all subsystems

/system/felix (B)

Specific to Felix path
Less broad than /system/*
Still under system directory
Targets Felix components

/felix/console/* (C)

All Felix console paths
Different root location (/felix vs /system)
Targets console functionality
Standard OSGi console path

/console/felix (D)

Incorrect/non-standard path
Not a valid AEM path
Wrong order of terms
Would not work
