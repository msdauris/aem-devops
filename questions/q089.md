## Correct Answer
C) Add high value site pages to the Production Pipeline Experience Audit list. 

## Explanation
AEM as a Cloud Service includes Experience Audit as part of the Cloud Manager Production Pipeline. This tool evaluates key web quality metrics such as:

Performance (Page Load Times, Core Web Vitals)
Accessibility (WCAG Compliance)
SEO (Metadata, Indexing, Structured Data)
By adding high-value pages to the Experience Audit, the DevOps engineer ensures that critical site areas are automatically tested before deployment. This minimizes risks associated with the redesign.
