## Question
When monitoring replication agents, for which two event should a monitoring system provide alerts? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) More than 10,000 items in the queue  <br /> 
B) 403 in the replication log  <br /> 
C) Queue blocked <br /> 
D) 200 in the replication log  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) More than 10,000 items in the queue  <br /> 
C) Queue blocked <br /> 

## Explanation
The two conditions that should trigger monitoring alerts are:

A) More than 10,000 items in the queue
C) Queue blocked

Here's why:

1. Large queue (A):
   - Indicates replication bottleneck
   - Could lead to content sync issues
   - Shows potential system problems
   - Critical threshold for intervention

2. Queue blocked (C):
   - Critical failure condition
   - Stops content publication
   - Requires immediate attention
   - System not functioning properly

Why others aren't alert worthy:
- B) 403: While important, single errors less critical
- D) 200: Success code, not an alert condition

Critical monitoring metrics:
```
Queue Health:
- Size (should be < 10,000)
- Status (should not be blocked)
```

These conditions require immediate attention to maintain system health.
