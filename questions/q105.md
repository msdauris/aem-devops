## Question
When should a DevOps engineer schedule maintenance tasks?

## Options
A) During a backup window  <br /> 
B) During planned downtimes  <br /> 
C) During other maintenance tasks  <br /> 
D) During out of office hours  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) During planned downtimes  <br /> 

## Explanation
### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
**B) During planned downtimes**  

### **Explanation:**  
- **Planned downtimes** are **pre-scheduled periods** when **maintenance tasks** such as updates, backups, and system optimizations can be performed **without disrupting business operations**.  
- This ensures minimal **impact on users and services** while allowing critical maintenance to be completed safely.  
- **Planned downtimes** are typically **communicated in advance** to stakeholders and scheduled **outside of peak business hours**.

### ‚ùå **Why are the other options incorrect?**  
- **A) During a backup window**  
  - **Backups should not run simultaneously** with maintenance tasks that modify data.  
  - Maintenance tasks might **corrupt the backup** or cause **inconsistent states** if changes occur mid-backup.  

- **C) During other maintenance tasks**  
  - Running **multiple maintenance tasks at once** can cause **unexpected issues**, conflicts, or system overload.  
  - Tasks should be **sequenced properly** to avoid **service disruptions**.  

- **D) During out of office hours**  
  - While **out-of-office hours** are generally **preferred**, the key factor is that it must be a **planned downtime**.  
  - Some organizations operate **24/7**, meaning **off-hours might still impact some users**.  

### **Final Answer:** ‚úÖ **B) During planned downtimes** üöÄ  
This ensures **minimal disruption** and proper **coordination** with stakeholders.
