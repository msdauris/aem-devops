## Question
After deployment, publishers still show old static pictures.
Which action must a DevOps engineer take to fix this issue?

## Options
A) Reset Dispatcher Cache  <br /> 
B) Restart Dispatcher  <br /> 
C) Restart Load Balancer  <br /> 
D) Restart AEM  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Reset Dispatcher Cache  <br /> 

## Explanation
A) Reset Dispatcher Cache is the correct answer.

Let's understand why:

1. Symptoms:
   - Old static pictures showing
   - After deployment
   - On publishers
   - Content not updating

2. Why Reset Dispatcher Cache is correct:
   - Static files are cached by dispatcher
   - Cache needs clearing to serve new versions
   - No need for service restarts
   - Quickest and correct solution

3. Why others are incorrect:
   - B) Dispatcher restart: Too extreme, won't clear cache
   - C) Load Balancer restart: Not related to content serving
   - D) AEM restart: Won't affect cached content

Solution flow:
```
1. Deploy new content ✓
2. Content on publishers ✓
3. Clear dispatcher cache
4. New content served
```

Resetting the dispatcher cache forces it to fetch fresh content from the publishers.
