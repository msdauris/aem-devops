## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to add multiple custom domains to identify the environments and sites with unique branded names in a self-service manner via the Cloud Manager Ul.
What should the DevOps engineer do?

## Options
A) Remove the default domain name after attaching domains to the Publish Service  <br /> 
B) Assign a wildcard domain name to the Publish Service <br /> 
C) Add a domain for each of the sites on the Publish Service  <br /> 
D) Attach domains to the Sites service on the Production authoring instance <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Add a domain for each of the sites on the Publish Service

## Explanation
C) Add a domain for each of the sites on the Publish Service is correct because:

Clear environment identification
Manageable through Cloud Manager
Supports multiple sites
Other options don't meet requirements:

A) Removing default domain doesn't add custom domains
B) Wildcard domain lacks individual site branding
D) Author instance isn't relevant for public domains

Individual domain management
Specific to each site's needs
