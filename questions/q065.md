## Question
A DevOps engineer is migrating custom index definitions in preparation to move an on-premise instance to the AEM as a Cloud Service. The on-premise AEM instance contains indexes in the following locations:
- under /apps/my-app/oak-index
- under /content/my-site/oak-index
- under /oak:index
The indexes must be consolidated before using the Index Converter utility.
Which two possible paths should the DevOps engineer consolidate the index to? (Choose two.) .

## Options
A) /content/my-site/oak-index  <br /> 
B) /apps/my-app/oak-index  <br /> 
C) /oak:index  <br /> 
D) /conf/my-site/settings/oak-index  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) /apps/my-app/oak-index  <br /> 
D) /conf/my-site/settings/oak-index  <br />

## Notes
The correct answers are:

**B) /apps/my-app/oak-index**  
**D) /conf/my-site/settings/oak-index**  

### Explanation:
When migrating custom index definitions for **AEM as a Cloud Service**, indexes must be stored in locations compatible with the **Index Converter utility** and **best practices for AEM as a Cloud Service**. 

1. **Indexes under `/oak:index`** are system-level indexes and should not be used for defining application-specific indexes.
2. **Indexes under `/content/my-site/oak-index`** are not recommended, as they reside within content paths, which is not ideal for AEM as a Cloud Service.

Instead, indexes should be consolidated to **either of the following**:
- **`/apps/my-app/oak-index`** → Used for application-specific indexes that are deployed as part of the codebase.
- **`/conf/my-site/settings/oak-index`** → Used for content-related indexes that need to be configurable.

Thus, the correct answers are **B and D**.
