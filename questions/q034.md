## Question
When configuring replication agents, under which path of the repository are agents stored for the AEM author instance?

## Options
A) /etc/agents/replication/author  <br /> 
B) /etc/agents/replication.author  <br /> 
C) /etc/author/agents/replication  <br /> 
D) /etc/replication/agents.author  <br /> 

## Correct Answer

- Follows AEM naming conventions

Others are incorrect:
```
A) /etc/agents/replication/author
- Wrong order of components
- Non-standard structure

B) /etc/agents/replication.author
- Uses dot instead of slash
- Incorrect hierarchy

C) /etc/author/agents/replication
