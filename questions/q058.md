## Question
A problem is found on an AEM instance.
How can the DevOps Engineer enable the developers to step through the actual code that is running?

## Options
A) Start AEM with the debug runmode set  <br /> 
B) Connect to the JVM using a JMX connection  <br /> 
C) Start AEM with the remote debugging JVM parameter  <br /> 
D) Create an SSH tunnel to access the AEM java port  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Start AEM with the remote debugging JVM parameter

## Explanation
C) Start AEM with the remote debugging JVM parameter is correct.

To enable remote debugging:
```java
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n
```

Other options don't provide code-level debugging:
- A) Debug runmode: Only changes logging levels
- B) JMX: For monitoring, not debugging
- D) SSH tunnel: Network access only

Developers can then connect IDE debuggers to step through running code.
