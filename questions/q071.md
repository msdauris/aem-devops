## Question
A customer's Sandbox environment is hibernated, and the customer wants it to stay in that state until they are ready for testing. While hibernated, the customer wants custom code deployed, and they should have the new code once the environment is de-hibernated.
What should the DevOps engineer do?

## Options
A) Use Developer Console to de-hibernate the environment and then deploy the code  <br /> 
B) Create a hibernate branch in Git and perform an update from this branch <br /> 
C) Use a pipeline to deploy custom code to the hibernated environment  <br /> 
D) Use Cloud Manager to de-hibernate the environment and then deploy the code  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Use a pipeline to deploy custom code to the hibernated environment  <br />

## Notes
C) Use a pipeline to deploy custom code to the hibernated environment is correct.

Why:
1. Hibernated environments can still receive code deployments
2. Pipeline deployments work regardless of environment state
3. Code will be ready when de-hibernated
4. No need to wake up environment

Why others are incorrect:
- A & D) No need to de-hibernate just for code deployment
- B) "Hibernate branch" isn't a real thing in AEM Cloud Service

The process:
```
1. Environment stays hibernated
2. Run pipeline deployment
3. Code gets deployed
4. When customer de-hibernates later
5. New code is already there
```

This is efficient because it:
- Saves resources (environment stays hibernated)
- Prepares environment for testing
- Follows cloud service best practices
