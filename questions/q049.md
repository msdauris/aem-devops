## Question
A company is launching a new multinational AEM site. The new site will have a large pool of authors all over the world.
- The company needs to be sure it can handle the load.
- The load requirements for the new site are as follows:
- A daily load scaling from 100 to 1000 authors
- Create multiple pages and live copies (including MSM rollouts)
- Upload multiple images into Assets
- Assign 1000 tags to each new pages
What can the DevOps Engineer do to make sure the AEM instance can handle the load?

## Options
A) Use standard Cloud Manager tests  <br /> 
B) Use Adobe Tough Day 2  <br /> 
C) Set up a cold standby instance  <br /> 
D) Set up auto scaling  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Use Adobe Tough Day 2 

## Explanation
Given these requirements (heavy author load, multiple operations), B) Use Adobe Tough Day 2 is the correct answer.

Here's why:

1. Requirements matching:
- Variable load (100-1000 authors)
- Complex operations (MSM, Assets)
- High volume tasks (1000 tags)
- Author-focused testing

2. Why Tough Day 2 is best:
- Can simulate author activities
- Tests heavy concurrent load
- Tests complex operations
- Designed for this scenario

3. Why others don't fit:
- A) Cloud Manager tests: Not detailed enough for author testing
- C) Cold standby: Doesn't test performance
- D) Auto scaling: Not applicable for author instance

Tough Day 2 can:
```
- Simulate multiple authors
- Test MSM operations
- Test asset uploads
- Test tagging operations
- Run concurrent operations
- Measure system performance
```

It's specifically designed to stress test AEM author environments under heavy load.

## Notes
Let's analyze these different performance/availability approaches:

1. **Cloud Manager tests (A)**
- Built-in performance testing
- Part of CM pipeline
- Quality gates
- Basic performance validation

2. **Adobe Tough Day 2 (B)**
- Stress testing tool
- Simulates heavy load
- Tests system limits
- More intensive testing

3. **Cold standby instance (C)**
- Disaster recovery solution
- Backup system
- Not for performance
- High availability feature

4. **Auto scaling (D)**
- Dynamic resource adjustment
- Resource optimization
- Performance management
- Automated scaling

Key differences:
```
Testing Tools:           vs    System Solutions:
A) Cloud Manager             C) Cold standby
B) Tough Day 2              D) Auto scaling

Performance Check:       vs    Availability:
A) Basic validation          C) Backup system
B) Stress testing           D) Resource scaling
```

Each serves different purposes:
- A/B: Testing and validation
- C: Disaster recovery
- D: Resource management
