## Question
A client is submitting a form that contains a CSRF token that is passed using the 'CSRF-Token' HTTP header. When looking at the web server access logs the header is printed out, but on the AEM instance the value is not present in the request.
What should the DevOps engineer configure to make the values available on the AEM instance?

## Options
A) Add "Header set CSRF-Token" in the virtual host configuration<br /> 
B) Add 'X-Forwarded-Header: CSRF-Token' in the virtual host configuration  <br /> 
C) Add the /clientheaders { "CSRF-Token" }' in the dispatcher configuration  <br /> 
D) Add 'filter /0001 {/type "allow" /glob "CSRF-Token" }' in the dispatcher configuration  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Add the /clientheaders { "CSRF-Token" }' in the dispatcher configuration 

## Explanation
C) Add the /clientheaders { "CSRF-Token" } in the dispatcher configuration is correct.

Here's why:

1. The problem:
   - CSRF token in HTTP header
   - Visible in web server logs
   - Not reaching AEM instance
   - Being blocked at dispatcher level

2. Why /clientheaders is correct:
   - Explicitly allows header pass-through
   - Configured in dispatcher.any
   - Standard way to forward headers
   - Correct syntax for header forwarding

3. Why others are incorrect:
   - A) Header set: Wrong approach, doesn't forward
   - B) X-Forwarded-Header: Incorrect syntax
   - D) Filter rule: For paths, not headers

Configuration in dispatcher.any:
```
/clientheaders {
    "CSRF-Token"
    # other headers...
}
```

This tells dispatcher to forward the CSRF-Token header to AEM.
