## Question
Recently published content is not visible on the search results on the public website.
- All results show on the author environment
- Some results show on the publish environment
- The LastindexedTime metric is not updated when checking the Async Indexer stats MBean
- The user is trying to find the page by the title 
- The following line appears regularly in the log:
08.01.2019 01:22:04.474 *INFO* [pool-9-thread-2] org.apache.jackrabbit.ok.plugins.index.IndexUpdate Reindexing will be performed for following indexes [/oak:index/damFileSize, / oak:index/lucene, /oak:index/cqLastModified]

How can the DevOps Engineer gather more information about the root cause of this issue?

## Options
A) Increase the logging level for stderr.log to DEBUG by setting a JVM option  <br /> 
B) Increase the logging level for stdout.log to DEBUG in the sling log support configuration  <br /> 
C) Increase the logging level for the health reports in the maintenance Ul  <br /> 
D) Increase the logging level for org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
D) Increase the logging level for org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index 

## Explanation
stderr.log DEBUG via JVM option (A)

System error logging
Set through Java parameters
Captures Java/system errors
Very low-level logging
Usually not needed for normal troubleshooting


stdout.log DEBUG via Sling config (B)

Standard output logging
Configured through Sling
General system output
Less specific
Not the best for targeted debugging


Health reports logging in maintenance UI (C)

Just for health checks
Limited scope
UI-based reports
Not actual log configuration
More about reporting than debugging


org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index logging (D)

Oak indexing specific
Targeted to indexing operations
OSGi configuration
Most specific option
Useful for index troubleshooting

Key Differences:
CopySystem Level (A,B)         vs     Application Level (C,D)
- Lower level                    - Higher level
- Broader scope                  - Specific components
- JVM/Sling config              - AEM config
- More noise                     - More focused
Usage scenarios:

A: System-wide issues
B: General troubleshooting
C: Health monitoring
D: Index-specific issues

## Notes
Why this is best:

Directly related to indexing issues
Will show detailed Oak index operations
Can see why reindexing is triggered
Can track index updates
Specific to the problem area


Why others aren't as good:

stderr.log (A): Too broad, system errors not relevant
stdout.log (B): Too general, won't focus on indexing
Health reports (C): Won't show index operation details
