## Question
- New content is not visible on the website when accessing it via the dispatcher.
- Replication from author to publish works fine.
- Dispatcher flush agent is present under /etc/replication/agents.author on the Publish instance, and enabled.
- The checkbox for Dispatcher flush agent configuration is ticked for enabled, when reviewed on the author instance.
- Rules in the dispatcher configuration are correct.
Which problem with the dispatcher flush agent is causing this issue?

## Options
A) It is not configured properly in the dispatcher configuration. <br /> 
B) It does not have enough permissions to receive the activation.  <br /> 
C) It is configured properly but located in the wrong path.  <br /> 
D) It is configured properly but uses the incorrect transport user.  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) It is configured properly but located in the wrong path. 

## Explanation
Current configuration shows flush agent at:
/etc/replication/agents.author
According to Adobe documentation, it should be at:
/etc/replication/agents.author/publish.html
Why this causes the issue:

Base path is correct (/etc/replication/agents.author)
But missing crucial /publish.html suffix
Without complete path, flush agent can't function properly
Results in cached content not being invalidated

Why other options are incorrect:

A) Dispatcher configuration is stated as correct
B) Permissions aren't the issue if path is incorrect
D) Transport user isn't relevant if path is wrong


This is why content updates aren't visible through dispatcher even though:

Replication to publish works
Agent is enabled
Dispatcher rules are correct

The missing /publish.html in the path prevents proper flush agent functionality.
