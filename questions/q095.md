## Question
Which three regular maintenance tasks should be executed and scheduled regularly? (Choose three.)

## Options
A) Workflow purge  <br /> 
B) User cache purge  <br /> 
C) Version purging  <br /> 
D) Audit log purge  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Workflow purge  <br />
C) Version purging  <br /> 
D) Audit log purge  <br />

## Explanation
Regular maintenance tasks are essential in AEM to ensure optimal performance, storage efficiency, and system health. The following three tasks should be executed and scheduled regularly:

A) Workflow Purge ✅

Why?
Completed workflows consume storage and slow down AEM over time.
Purging old workflows reduces repository bloat and improves performance.
Best Practice:
Schedule the workflow purge job to remove completed workflows periodically (e.g., keep only the last 30 days).
C) Version Purging ✅

Why?
Every time a page or asset is modified, AEM creates a new version.
If not purged, this can lead to excessive storage usage and slow queries.
Best Practice:
Configure a version purge policy to remove older versions while keeping a reasonable history (e.g., last 5 versions).
D) Audit Log Purge ✅

Why?
AEM logs audit events such as user activities, content changes, and system operations.
These logs grow over time and consume repository space.
Best Practice:
Purge old audit logs to prevent performance degradation and unnecessary storage consumption.

Why not B) User Cache Purge? ❌
User cache purge is NOT a standard maintenance task that needs regular scheduling.
AEM automatically manages user caches, and purging user caches too frequently can cause unnecessary performance overhead.
Caching strategies should be handled via dispatcher and AEM cache settings, not as a scheduled purge job.

## Notes
A) Workflow purge - CORRECT

Removes completed workflow instances
Prevents workflow database growth
Important for system performance

C) Version purging - CORRECT

Removes old content versions
Manages content history
Prevents repository bloat

D) Audit log purge - CORRECT

Cleans up audit logs
Prevents log accumulation
Maintains system health

B) User cache purge is incorrect:

Not a standard maintenance task
Cache is managed automatically
Not typically scheduled

These three tasks (A, C, D) are essential regular maintenance activities to:

Keep system performance optimal
Manage storage space
Prevent database/repository growth
