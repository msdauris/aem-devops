## Notes
B) TarMK (Tar Micro Kernel) is the correct choice for this author instance scenario because:

1. The requirements:
- 1500 unique users/day
- 300 concurrent users
- Author instance

2. Why TarMK is appropriate:
- Standard for author instances
- Handles up to 1000 concurrent users
- Optimized for author workloads
- Adobe's recommended choice for author

3. Why others aren't suitable:
- A) RDBMS: Not a standard AEM persistence layer
- C) MongoMK: Only needed for multiple author instances/clustering
- D) S3: Storage layer, not a persistence mechanism

TarMK limitations and capabilities:
```
TarMK Author Instance:
- Up to ~1000 concurrent users
- Single author instance
- Good performance
- Simple maintenance
```

The specified load (300 concurrent) is well within TarMK's capabilities for an author instance.
