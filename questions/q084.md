## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to add functionality to allow developers to start Cloud Manager builds from their local environments via a bash script or IDE plugin.
What should the DevOps engineer add after creating an Adobe 1/0 project?

## Options
A) An API for Cloud Manager  <br /> 
B) A plugin for Cloud Manager  <br /> 
C) An Event for Cloud Manager  <br /> 
D) [Option text]  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) An API for Cloud Manager 

## Explanation
To allow developers to trigger Cloud Manager builds from their local environments (via a Bash script or an IDE plugin), the DevOps engineer must integrate with the Cloud Manager API.

❌ B) A plugin for Cloud Manager
No such concept exists in Adobe Cloud Manager.
Plugins are not required to trigger builds.

❌ C) An Event for Cloud Manager
Events are notifications about pipeline status, not for triggering builds.
Doesn’t allow developers to start builds manually.

## Notes
Why use the Cloud Manager API?
- Automates build and deployment triggers from external tools.
- Allows scripting and CI/CD integrations for local or remote execution.
- Supports authentication via Adobe I/O after setting up an Adobe I/O project.

Steps to Implement:
- Create an Adobe I/O project with Cloud Manager API access.
- Generate API credentials for authentication.
- Use API calls to trigger builds (POST /api/program/{programId}/pipeline/{pipelineId}/execution).
- Integrate API calls into a Bash script or an IDE plugin.
