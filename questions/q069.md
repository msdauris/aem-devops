## Notes
Let's break down these different methods of adding admin users in AEM Cloud Service:

1. **AEM Administrators-xxx product profile in Admin Console (A)**
- Cloud Service approved method
- Uses Adobe Admin Console
- IMS authentication
- Proper cloud way

2. **Oak LDAP synchronization (B)**
- On-premise approach
- Not applicable for Cloud Service
- LDAP not used in Cloud
- Legacy method

3. **Direct AEM instance Administrators group (C)**
- Direct instance management
- Not supported in Cloud Service
- Local user management
- Legacy approach

Key differences:
```
Cloud Service Method:     vs    Legacy Methods:
Admin Console (A)             LDAP Sync (B)
- IMS Based                   Direct AEM (C)
- Centralized                 - Instance specific
- Proper cloud way           - Not cloud compatible
```

For Cloud Service, Admin Console (A) is the only correct method as user management is handled through IMS.
