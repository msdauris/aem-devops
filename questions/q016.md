## Question
After which maintenance processes can a datastore garbage collection achieve the most regain of disk space?

## Options
A) Workflow purge  <br /> 
B) Compaction  <br /> 
C) Version purge  <br /> 
D) Re-index  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Compaction

## Explanation
Workflow Purge

Cleans up completed workflow instances
Removes old workflow data from repository
Prevents workflow database from growing too large
Important for system performance
Default: Purges workflows older than 7 days


Compaction

Performs repository optimization
Removes unused repository revisions
Reclaims disk space
Improves overall repository performance
Can be online (daily) or offline


Version Purge

Removes old versions of pages/assets
Manages content versioning
Prevents repository bloat from version history
Can be configured for different retention periods
Important for long-term repository health


Re-index

Rebuilds Oak indexes from scratch
Fixes corrupted or inconsistent indexes
Can be resource-intensive
Not a regular maintenance task
Only done when needed (troubleshooting)

Key differences:

Workflow Purge: Cleans workflow data
Compaction: Optimizes repository storage
Version Purge: Manages content versions
Re-index: Repairs search functionality

All are maintenance tasks but serve different purposes:

Workflow/Version purge: Clean up old data
Compaction: Optimize storage
Re-index: Fix search issues

## Notes
Compaction removes old revisions
This creates unreferenced binaries
Datastore GC can then clean these up
Results in maximum space recovery
