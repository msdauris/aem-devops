## Question
A DevOps Engineer is deploying an AEM environment in a private network.
How can the DevOps Engineer restrict other clients or applications from flushing the cache?

## Options
A) Set permissions on the publish instance by using Access Control Lists to allow the publish instance private IPs <br /> 
B) Configure the /filter section of the dispatcher configuration with an allow rule to make sure the correct client's private
IPs are allowed to flush the cache <br /> 
C) The allowedClients section in the dispatcher configuration should only allow the publish instances private IPs <br /> 
D) Set up client certificate authentication in the dispatcher configuration <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) The allowedClients section in the dispatcher configuration should only allow the publish instances private IPs

## Explanation
Let's analyze why:

1. allowedClients is specifically for this purpose:
```
/allowedClients {
    /0001 { /glob "10.0.0.*" }  # Allow publish instance IPs
    /0002 { /glob "localhost" }
}
```

2. Why other options aren't correct:
- A) ACLs on publish don't control dispatcher access
- B) /filter section is for content access, not cache invalidation
- D) Client certificates are overkill and not standard for this

The allowedClients section:
- Restricts which IPs can send flush requests
- Simple to configure
- Standard security measure
- Specifically designed for this purpose

This ensures only authorized publish instances can invalidate the dispatcher cache.
