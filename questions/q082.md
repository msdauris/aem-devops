## Question
A DevOps engineer is monitoring an Adobe Managed Services AEM Sites environment. AEM Sites is being run for the customer. During the performance tests conducted via Cloud Manager, the DevOps engineer notices high CPU utilization.
What should the DevOps engineer do?

## Options
A) Log in to the server using SSH on production, then rerun the test and run top in parallel.  <br /> 
B) Create a support ticket to the CSE to provide the logs of AEM from during the test run. <br /> 
C) Connect VisualGC to the JVM using JMX while running the tests to gather JVM CPU usage. <br /> 
D) [Option text]  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Create a support ticket to the CSE to provide the logs of AEM from during the test run.

## Explanation
In Adobe Managed Services (AMS), Adobe manages the infrastructure, and customers do not have direct SSH access to production environments. High CPU utilization can indicate:

Inefficient custom code (e.g., infinite loops, excessive resource usage).
Heavy request loads causing performance degradation.
Memory leaks leading to excessive garbage collection.
Since AMS environments are managed by Adobe, the correct approach is to:

Gather logs from AEM during the test.
Submit a support ticket to Adobe's Customer Support Engineering (CSE).
Work with CSE to analyze logs and identify performance bottlenecks.

Why NOT the Other Options?
❌ A) Log in to the server using SSH on production, then rerun the test and run top in parallel.
AMS does NOT allow direct SSH access to production servers.
Even if SSH were available in a lower environment, it wouldn't be applicable in AMS production.

❌ C) Connect VisualGC to the JVM using JMX while running the tests to gather JVM CPU usage.
JMX is not enabled in AMS environments for security reasons.
VisualGC requires direct access to the JVM, which is not available in AMS.
