## Question
A company is anticipating a large migration of web assets into their AEM instance. Bulk upload of large assets is typically a very resource intensive process.
The DevOps Engineer needs to avoid any potential performance impact and high Java heap consumption.
Which change should the DevOps Engineer make to the Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration?

## Options
A) Set the queue.maxparallel value to 50% of the CPU cores of the server running the AEM instance
B) Set the queue.retries value to 10 and any failed attempts are not rescheduled and assumed to have failed
C) Set the queue. keep/obs to enabled making sure successful finished jobs are kept to provide a complete history
D) Set the queue.type to "Ordered"

## Correct Answer
A) Set the queue.maxparallel value to 50% of the CPU cores of the server running the AEM instance

## Explanation
queue.maxparallel value at 50% of CPU cores:

Controls how many workflow jobs run simultaneously
Example: 8 core server = 4 parallel workflows
Balances performance with system resources
Common best practice for performance


queue.retries value of 10:

Controls how many times a failed job is retried
"Failed attempts are not rescheduled" means no more retries after limit
Hard failure after 10 attempts
Clear failure handling


queue.keep/obs enabled:

Not a real parameter (appears incorrect)
"obs" isn't standard AEM terminology
Keeping workflow history is handled differently
This appears to be an incorrect option


queue.type "Ordered":

Controls how jobs are processed
Ordered means sequential processing
Maintains job execution order
Can impact performance but ensures order

The most technically correct would be A (queue.maxparallel) because:

It's a real parameter
Uses established best practice (50% of cores)
Balances resources effectively
Common performance optimization

## Notes
Configure these services to limit the maximum number of concurrently running workflow processes.


NOTE
Configuring these job queues affects all workflows unless you have created a job queue for a specific workflow model (see Configure the Queue for a Specific Workflow Model below).
Configuration in the Repository
If you are configuring the services using a sling:OsgiConfig node, you must find the PID of the existing services, for example: org.apache.sling.event.jobs.QueueConfiguration.370aad73-d01b-4a0b-abe4-20198d85f705. You can discover the PID using the Web Console.

Configure the property named queue.maxparallel.

Configuration in the Web Console
To configure these services using the Web Console, locate the existing configuration items below the Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration service factory.

Configure the property named Maximum Parallel Jobs.
