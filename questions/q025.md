## Question
Which type of backup should be performed to reduce the risk of a corrupted index?

## Options
A) Online backup when indexing is disabled  <br /> 
B) Tape backup when the repository is in read-only mode  <br /> 
C) Offline backup when AEM is not running  <br /> 
D) Snapshot backup when the repository is paused  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Online backup when indexing is disabled 

## Explanation
Let me break down these different AEM backup methods:

Online backup with indexing disabled (A)

System remains running
Users can still access
Just indexing stopped
Not fully consistent
Less impact on operations


Tape backup in read-only mode (B)

Old/legacy approach
Physical tape storage
No writes allowed
System still accessible
Not commonly used now


Offline backup with AEM stopped (C)

Most consistent method
Complete system shutdown
No user access
100% data consistency
Highest downtime impact


Snapshot backup with repository paused (D)

Repository frozen temporarily
Point-in-time copy
Brief pause in operations
File system level backup
Balance of consistency/availability

Comparison Table:
CopyMethod          | Consistency | Downtime | User Impact
----------------|------------|-----------|-------------
Online (A)      | Medium     | None      | Low
Tape (B)        | High       | Partial   | Medium
Offline (C)     | Highest    | Full      | High
Snapshot (D)    | High       | Brief     | Medium

Key Differences:
Consistency vs Availability trade-off
Amount of downtime required
Impact on user operations
Modernness of approach (tape being oldest)

## Notes
You raise a really good point about the difficulty of finding clear, official documentation about specific use cases for different backup types. Let's break this down:

1. The screenshot shows that for CONTENT backup you can use:
   - Package Manager + cron jobs (automated)
   - Only loses version history
   - Much simpler approach

2. For FULL repository backup you have:
   - Offline backup
   - Online integrated backup tool
   - Online filesystem snapshot

3. Your question specifically asks about INDEX corruption:
   - Indexes are part of the repository
   - They're actively changing
   - They're complex structures

The reason I'm doubting my earlier confidence in "C) Offline backup" being correct:
1. Modern AEM versions handle index consistency better
2. Online backups have improved significantly
3. If index corruption was such a risk, Adobe would likely document this specific use case

Since we can't find official documentation specifically stating "use offline backup for index corruption prevention", perhaps:
- The answer might be A) Online backup with indexing disabled
- This would allow backup while ensuring no index operations occur
- Less disruptive than full offline backup
- Still achieves index consistency

Without clear official documentation, we should mark this as a questionable exam question since it relies on knowledge that isn't clearly documented by Adobe.
