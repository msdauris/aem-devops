## Notes
For migrating to AEM as Cloud Service using Content Transfer Tool (CTT), two required actions are:

B) Upgrade the instance to AEM 6.5 <br /> 
C) Review total index size <br /> 

Why these are correct:

1. Upgrade to 6.5 is required because:
   - CTT requires minimum AEM 6.5
   - Direct migration from 6.2 not supported
   - Prerequisite for CTT usage

2. Review index size because:
   - Cloud Service has different indexing approach
   - Index size affects migration
   - Important for migration planning

Why others aren't required for CTT:
- A) Application code refactoring is separate from content transfer
- D) Service packs aren't required for CTT (just need 6.5)

The order would be:
1. Upgrade to 6.5
2. Review index size
3. Then use CTT
