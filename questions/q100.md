# Question ID: q100

## Category

## Question
A page cannot be rendered (HTTP response 500). The log file shows a NullPointerException. The source code points to a missing OSGi service "NavigationService"
The code uses @Reference to inject this service.
What are four possible causes of this issue? (Choose four.)

## Options
A) The bundle that contains the implementation of the NavigationService is in state INSTALLED<br /> 
B) The bundle that contains the implementation of the NavigationService is in state ACTIVE  <br /> 
C) The bundle that contains the implementation of the NavigationService is in state RESOLVED <br /> 
D) The implementation of the SCR component has unsatisfied references  <br /> 
E) The bundle that contains the implementation shows different versions in "Bundle Location" string compared to
"Version" as shown in Felix Console <br /> 
F) The interface NavigationService and the implementation of the NavigationService reside in different bundles <br /> 
G) The @Reference annotation was invalidly used in a class that is not a SCR component <br /> 
H) There is more than one implementation of the NavigationService active in the system <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) The bundle that contains the implementation of the NavigationService is in state INSTALLED<br /> 
D) The implementation of the SCR component has unsatisfied references  <br /> 
F) The interface NavigationService and the implementation of the NavigationService reside in different bundles <br /> 
G) The @Reference annotation was invalidly used in a class that is not a SCR component <br /> 

## Explanation
Let's analyze what could cause a NullPointerException with a missing OSGi service:

Correct answers:

A) Bundle in INSTALLED state
- Can't provide services
- Dependencies not resolved
- Common cause of missing services

D) Unsatisfied references
- Component can't activate
- Missing required dependencies
- Prevents service from starting

F) Interface and implementation in different bundles
- Version mismatches possible
- Bundle resolution issues
- Can cause service unavailability 

G) Invalid @Reference usage
- Wrong annotation placement
- Not a proper SCR component
- Can't receive service injection

Why these four scenarios would cause the issue:
```
No Service Available when:
1. Bundle stuck in INSTALLED (A)
2. Component references not met (D)
3. Bundle dependency issues (F)
4. Incorrect component setup (G)
```

Why others aren't causes:
- B) ACTIVE state means working correctly
- C) RESOLVED state means ready to start
- E) Bundle location not relevant
- H) Multiple implementations allowed
