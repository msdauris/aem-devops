## Question
What must a DevOps engineer do to install an AEM instance as an author?

## Options
A) Provide java property instance.type=author <br /> 
B) Set run mode for author in an OSGI console after the first start <br /> 
C) Change the name of the jar file to have author as run mode  <br /> 
D) Provide the run mode "author" on a first installation  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
[Letter of correct option]

## Explanation
### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
**D) Provide the run mode "author" on a first installation**  

### **Explanation:**  
- In **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)**, the **run mode** determines whether an instance is an **Author** or **Publish** instance.  
- To install an **AEM Author instance**, the **run mode** must be **explicitly provided during the first installation**.  
- This is done by passing the **run mode as a JVM parameter** when starting AEM:  
  ```sh
  java -jar aem-quickstart.jar -r author
  ```
- This ensures that the **AEM instance is configured as an Author** from the first startup.  

---

### ‚ùå **Why are the other options incorrect?**  
- **A) Provide Java property `instance.type=author`**  
  - This is **not a valid property** for defining the **run mode** in AEM.  
  - Run modes are set using `-r author` or via **sling.properties**.  

- **B) Set run mode for author in an OSGi console after the first start**  
  - **Run modes cannot be changed via OSGi console after installation**.  
  - They are set **at startup** and **cannot be modified dynamically**.  

- **C) Change the name of the jar file to have "author" as run mode**  
  - Renaming the **JAR file** does **not affect the run mode**.  
  - The correct method is to use the **`-r author`** parameter at startup.  

---

### **Final Answer:** ‚úÖ **D) Provide the run mode "author" on a first installation** üöÄ  
This ensures the **AEM instance runs as an Author** from the very beginning.

## Notes
D) Provide the run mode "author" on a first installation is correct.

To install AEM as an author instance:
```bash
java -jar aem.jar -r author
```

Why other options are incorrect:

- A) instance.type is not a valid Java property
- B) Run modes can't be changed after installation
- C) Renaming jar doesn't set run mode properly

The -r author parameter:
- Must be set at first startup
- Cannot be changed later
- Determines instance type
- Standard installation method

This is the official way to designate an instance as author during installation.
