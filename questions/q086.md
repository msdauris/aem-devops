## Question
Developers add a content package module named "ui.utils" to the Maven project. The module provides debugging servlets for use in testing features for a website hosted on AEM as a Cloud Service. These servlets are not secured and should not be deployed to the production Cloud Service environment.
What should the DevOps engineer add?

## Options
A) Add "" element identifying the "ui.utils" artifact and a matching "" element to the "all" package pom.ml with a target path of /apps/mysite-packages/application/install.  <br /> 
B) Add a "'' element in the "ui.utils" pom.ml that adds the "all" to the ui.tils package properties, which is activated when an env variable is set to a particular value.  <br /> 
C) Add a pipeline to the team's Cl service that builds the ui.utils content package and uploads it to the Author server's
CRX Package Manager servlet after receiving a successful response from a Cloud Manager webhook.  <br /> 
D) [Option text]  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Add a "'' element in the "ui.utils" pom.ml that adds the "all" to the ui.tils package properties, which is activated when an env variable is set to a particular value.

## Explanation
- Profiles in Maven allow conditional builds based on the environment.
- Since ui.utils should not be deployed to production, a Maven profile can be used to enable or disable this module dynamically.
- This ensures that the debugging servlets are only included in development or testing but excluded from production.
- Using an environment variable-based activation ensures Cloud Manager does not deploy it to production while still allowing it in lower environments (dev, stage).
