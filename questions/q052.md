## Question
An AEM instance is restarted with the command: java -Dsling.run.modes=author-jar cq-publish.jar-r author. The sling. properties includes the line sling.run.modes=publish.
In which runmode is AEM started?

## Options
A) Author runmode because the system property sling.run.modes has the highest priority  <br /> 
B) Publish runmode because the sling.properties file has the highest priority  <br /> 
C) Author runmode because the -r parameter has the highest priority <br /> 
D) Publish runmode because it is determined from the quickstart jar filename  <br />

## Notes
This is a great example of conflicting documentation and real-world testing! It shows:

1. Different Adobe docs say different things:
   - Doc [1]: Sling.properties > System property > jar file
   - Doc [2]: jar file > sling.properties > system property 

2. Sling documentation [3] suggests:
   - System properties override sling.properties

3. Real-world test shows:
   ```
   Test setup:
   - sling.properties set to 'publish'
   - jar renamed to 'cq-author-7502.jar'
   - Command uses -Dsling.run.modes=prod
   
   Result:
   - Instance started in 'prod' mode
   ```

This suggests system properties (-D) do have highest priority, but without clear, consistent documentation, we can't be 100% certain of the complete priority order.

For the exam question about `java -Dsling.run.modes=author -jar cq-publish.jar -r author`, we should:
1. Note this is a contested topic
2. Look for official current documentation
3. Consider verifying behavior in actual environment

This is a great example of why real-world testing and documentation verification are important in DevOps work.
