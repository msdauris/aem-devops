## Notes
Let's break down these SAML authentication configuration requirements:

1. **IdP PrivateKey, ServiceEntity ID, IdP URL (A)**
- Private Key (incorrect - should be certificate)
- Service Entity ID (correct)
- IdP URL (correct)
- Wrong component (private vs public)

2. **SSL certificate, ServiceEntity ID, IdP URL (B)**
- SSL certificate (wrong type of certificate)
- Service Entity ID (correct)
- IdP URL (correct)
- Wrong certificate type

3. **IdP certificate, ServiceEntity ID, IdP URL (C)**
- IdP certificate (correct)
- Service Entity ID (correct)
- IdP URL (correct)
- All components correct

Key differences:
```
Certificates:
- IdP certificate: For SAML validation
- SSL certificate: For transport security
- Private Key: Not used for IdP trust

Common elements:
- ServiceEntity ID
- IdP URL
```

C is correct as it has all required elements for SAML authentication setup.
