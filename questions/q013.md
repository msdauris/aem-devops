## Question
A DevOps Engineer is configuring the Dispatcher to connect with AEM over SSL, and must have specific properties in the dispatcher.any file. 
What must be set in the dispatcher.any file?

## Options
A) The /renders item includes a property named ssl of value true.  <br /> 
B) The /renders item includes a property named secure of value 1.  <br /> 
C) The /renders item includes a property named secure of value 0.  <br /> 
D) The /virtualhosts item includes a property named ssl of value true.  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) The /renders item includes a property named secure of value 1.

## Explanation
/renders with ssl=true

This tells dispatcher to use HTTPS when connecting to render (AEM publish) instances
About communication between dispatcher and AEM
Backend communication setting


/renders with secure=1

Similar to ssl=true
Older syntax/way of specifying secure connection
Value of 1 means enabled
Also for dispatcher â†’ AEM communication


/renders with secure=0

Disables secure connection requirement
Uses HTTP instead of HTTPS
Not recommended for production
Less secure option


/virtualhosts with ssl=true

Wrong location for SSL configuration
/virtualhosts is for domain mapping
SSL isn't configured here
This would be incorrect

```
/farms
{
   /secure
   {
      /virtualhosts
      {
         # select this farm for all incoming HTTPS requests
         "https://*"
      }
      /renders
      {
      /0001
         {
            # hostname or IP of the render
            /hostname "localhost"
            # port of the render
            /port "8443"
            # connect via HTTPS
            /secure "1"
         }
      }
     # the rest of the properties are omitted
   }

   /non-secure
   {
      /virtualhosts
      {
         # select this farm for all incoming HTTP requests
         "http://*"
      }
      /renders
      {
         /0001
      {
         # hostname or IP of the render
         /hostname "localhost"
         # port of the render
         /port "4503"
      }
   }
    # the rest of the properties are omitted
}
```

When faced with both new and old syntax in exam options AND official AEM documentation shows the older syntax (like /secure "1"), you should choose the older syntax option!
Here's why:

Documentation is king - if Adobe's official docs show /secure "1", that's what they'll consider correct
In this case, that would be option B: /renders with secure=1
Even though /ssl "true" might be newer, exams tend to align with official documentation
