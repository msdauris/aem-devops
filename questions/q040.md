## Question
According to Adobe best practices, how should a DevOps Engineer tailor the OSGi service configurations depending on the type of environment?

## Options
A) Leverage multiple content packages for each environment  <br /> 
B) Leverage configuration files in runmode dedicated folder <br /> 
C) Provide default configuration in the content package, and apply the differences using the OSGi console <br /> 
D) Use environment variables to identify the instance and environment type, then load the appropriate configuration files accordingly  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Leverage configuration files in runmode dedicated folder

## Explanation
Runmode folders provide:
- Environment-specific configurations
- Clear separation of configs
- Standard AEM mechanism
- Automated deployment

Structure example:
```
/config
  /author.dev
  /author.stage
  /author.prod
  /publish.dev
  /publish.stage
  /publish.prod
```

Other options deviate from best practices:
- A) Multiple packages: Hard to maintain
- C) OSGi console: Manual, risky
- D) Environment variables: Overly complex

## Notes
A) Multiple content packages per environment

Separate packages for each environment
Hard to maintain
Not scalable
Error-prone

B) Runmode folders for configuration

Standard AEM approach
Easy to maintain
Environment-specific configs
Built-in AEM feature

C) Default config with OSGi console override

Manual process
Not automated
Risky in production
Hard to track changes

D) Environment variables

Dynamic but complex
Requires additional logic
More maintenance overhead
Less predictable
