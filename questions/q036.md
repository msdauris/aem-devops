# Question ID: q036

## Category
What are the two benefits of running the version purge maintenance task? (Choose two.)

## Question
[Question text goes here]

## Options
A) Increases the system performance  <br /> 
B) Cleans up versions that can not be restored  <br /> 
C) Compacts disk space for unreferenced versions  <br /> 
D) Reclaims disk space <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Increases the system performance  <br />  D) Reclaims disk space

## Explanation
A) Increases system performance and D) Reclaims disk space are the two main benefits of version purge.

Version purge:
1. Frees up disk space by removing old versions
2. Improves system performance by reducing database size and query load

B and C are incorrect because:
- B implies unrecoverable data loss
- C confuses version purge with compaction

This matches the official docs which emphasize storage reclamation and performance benefits as primary outcomes of version purging.

## Notes
These describe different effects of version purging in AEM:

A) Increases performance
- Better system response
- Reduces database size
- Faster queries

B) Cleans unrestorable versions
- Removes corrupted versions
- Irreversible deletion
- Not primary purpose

C) Compacts unreferenced versions
- Consolidates storage
- Removes unused versions
- Optimizes storage

D) Reclaims disk space
- Main purpose
- Frees storage
- Most direct benefit

Key difference: D focuses on storage recovery, while others describe secondary benefits or incorrect outcomes.

Version purge primarily reclaims disk space (D), with performance improvement (A) as a beneficial side effect.
