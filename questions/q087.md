## Question
A customer wants duplicate assets detected regardless of filenames as they upload to AEM Asset.

How should the DevOps engineer set up the configuration?

## Options
A) In the ui.apps project, locate the config folder that targets the runmode and create a new .cfg.json file in /apps with the following: {"enabled":true, "detectMetadataField" :"dam:sha1" } <br /> 
B) In the ui.config project, locate the /conf/global/settings/dam folder that targets the runmode and create a new cfg.json file in /config/dam with the following: {"enabled":true, "detectMetadataField" :"dam:sha1"}  <br /> 
C) In the ui.apps project, locate the config folder that targets the runmode and create a new .cfg.json file in /apps with the following: {"detect_duplicate": true, "detectMetadataField": "dam:sha1" }  <br /> 
D) [Option text]  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) In the ui.apps project, locate the config folder that targets the runmode and create a new .cfg.json file in /apps with the following: {"detect_duplicate": true, "detectMetadataField": "dam:sha1" } 

## Explanation
AEM Assets uses SHA-1 hash (dam:sha1) to detect duplicate assets, ensuring that identical binary files are recognized even if filenames differ.

The correct way to configure this in AEM as a Cloud Service is:

Placing the configuration in the ui.apps project (where OSGi configurations reside).
Using the correct property names:
"detect_duplicate": true → Enables duplicate detection.
"detectMetadataField": "dam:sha1" → Uses SHA-1 for content-based detection.
