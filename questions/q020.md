## Question
A DevOps Engineer is configuring a non production deployment pipeline. The code quality is checked in the build pipeline.
A security check is configured in the deployment pipeline to identify any major security issues before a production deployment.
Which other check should be executed before deployment to production?

## Options
A) An OSGi configuration validity check for the new release  <br /> 
B) A performance check for the actual release functionality  <br /> 
C) A dispatcher invalidation rule check for replication functionality <br /> 
D) A sling models validation check for the new release  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) A performance check for the actual release functionality 

## Explanation
OSGi configuration validity check (A)

Validates OSGi configurations
Checks for misconfigurations
Ensures services are properly configured
Basic system health check
Fundamental for AEM operation


Performance check for release functionality (B)

Tests actual performance
Checks response times
Monitors resource usage
Validates real-world behavior
More comprehensive testing


Dispatcher invalidation rule check (C)

Tests caching/invalidation
Verifies replication flow
Checks dispatcher configuration
Tests content updates
Important for content delivery


Sling Models validation check (D)

Validates Sling Model mappings
Checks Java model classes
Tests component functionality
Code-level validation
Development-focused check

Key differences:
CopyConfiguration (A,C)    vs    Functional (B,D)
- Settings                    - Actual behavior
- Setup validation           - Runtime validation
- Static checks              - Dynamic checks
- System level               - Application level
Usage scenarios:

OSGi check: Before startup
Performance check: During/after deployment
Dispatcher check: Publishing setup
Sling check: Code deployment

## Notes
In this scenario, we're looking at deployment pipeline checks. Let's analyze what we have and what's missing:
Already configured:

Code quality check (in build pipeline)
Security check (in deployment pipeline)

Missing critical check:

Performance isn't verified
No validation of actual functionality
No load testing

Therefore, option B "A performance check for the actual release functionality" is the correct answer because:

Why performance check is crucial:

Validates actual runtime behavior
Catches performance regressions
Identifies resource issues
Tests real-world scenarios
Essential before production


Why other options aren't as critical:

OSGi config (A): More basic validation
Dispatcher rules (C): Important but narrower scope
Sling models (D): Already covered by code quality



Deployment Pipeline Best Practice:
CopyBuild Pipeline:        Deployment Pipeline:
- Code quality        - Security checks
- Unit tests          - Performance checks (missing)
- Compilation         - Integration tests
