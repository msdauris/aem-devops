## Question
How should a DevOps engineer prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against AEM 6.x instances?

## Options
A) By implementing a web application firewall and installing the latest security hoties re.  <br /> 
B) By configuring Sling, Adobe Dispatcher, a web application firewall, installing the latest security hotfixes and implementing a protected network environment  <br /> 
C) By leaving the Adobe Dispatcher set to the default configuration and installing the latest security hotfixes  <br /> 
D) By implementing a protected network environment installing the latest security hotfixes  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) By configuring Sling, Adobe Dispatcher, a web application firewall, installing the latest security hotfixes and implementing a protected network environment  <br /> 

## Explanation
The correct answer is:  

‚úÖ **B) By configuring Sling, Adobe Dispatcher, a web application firewall, installing the latest security hotfixes, and implementing a protected network environment**  

### **Explanation:**  
A **Denial of Service (DoS) attack** targets system resources, overwhelming them with requests and making them unresponsive. The best defense is a **multi-layered approach** that includes:  

1. **Sling Configuration**  
   - Limit **resource resolution recursion** (`sling.max.calls`) to prevent excessive request depth.  
   - Configure **rate limiting** and request filtering.  

2. **Adobe Dispatcher**  
   - Enable **IP whitelisting** and request filtering (`/filter` rules).  
   - Configure **caching** to reduce load on AEM.  
   - Set request limits (`/retryDelay`, `/renderTimeout`).  

3. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**  
   - Blocks malicious traffic **before it reaches AEM**.  
   - Can enforce rate limiting and **bot protection**.  

4. **Security Hotfixes**  
   - Regularly install the **latest AEM security hotfixes** to patch vulnerabilities.  

5. **Protected Network Environment**  
   - Use **firewalls** to limit external access.  
   - Restrict admin access to **internal IPs only**.  

### **Why Not the Other Options?**  
‚ùå **A) Only WAF and security hotfixes** ‚Üí **Insufficient** because Adobe Dispatcher and network security also play a critical role.  

‚ùå **C) Leaving Adobe Dispatcher at default** ‚Üí **Very insecure!** The default configuration is not optimized for security.  

‚ùå **D) Only network security and security hotfixes** ‚Üí **Misses key layers** like Sling hardening, Dispatcher rules, and a WAF.  

### **Final Answer: B** ‚úÖ  
A **multi-layered security approach** is the best way to prevent **DoS attacks** in AEM. üöÄ
