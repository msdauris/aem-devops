## Question
Which gate needs to be passed after the code is deployed?

## Options
A) Performance test gate  <br /> 
B) Compilation test gate  <br /> 
C) Code quality test gate  <br /> 
D) Unit test gate <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Performance test gate 

## Explanation
Performance Test Gate (A)

Tests system performance
Checks response times
Monitors resource usage
Load testing
Most comprehensive


Compilation Test Gate (B)

Basic code building
Verifies code compiles
Syntax checking
Most basic gate
First line of testing


Code Quality Test Gate (C)

Checks code standards
Static code analysis
Best practices validation
Common issues detection
Sonar/similar tools


Unit Test Gate (D)

Tests individual components
Function-level testing
Code coverage checks
Developer-written tests
Code behavior validation

Typical Pipeline Order:
1. Compilation (B)
   - Most basic
   - Must pass first

2. Unit Tests (D)
   - Code behavior
   - Quick feedback

3. Code Quality (C)
   - Style/standards
   - Static analysis

4. Performance (A)
   - Most comprehensive
   - Takes longest

Key Differences:
CopyBasic Gates (B,D)         vs     Advanced Gates (A,C)
- Faster                       - More time-consuming
- Code-focused                 - Broader scope
- Developer-centric           - System-centric
- Earlier in pipeline         - Later in pipeline

## Notes
Given that the question is asking about a gate that needs to be passed AFTER code deployment, the answer would be A) Performance test gate.
Here's why:

Looking at gate timing:

Compilation (B): Pre-deployment
Unit tests (D): Pre-deployment
Code quality (C): Pre-deployment
Performance (A): Post-deployment âœ“

Why Performance Gate must be post-deployment:

Needs actual running system
Tests real environment behavior
Validates actual user experience
Can't be done pre-deployment

Why others can't be the answer:

Compilation: Must happen before code can be deployed
Unit tests: Run during build phase
Code quality: Static analysis before deployment

Think of it like:
CopyPre-Deployment Gates  |  Post-Deployment Gates
-------------------  |  --------------------
Compilation          |  Performance
Unit Tests           |  
Code Quality         |
