## Question
Given the Sling log rotation configuration, which two controls should be used for the rotation of the log? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) A time/date schedule  <br /> 
B) A maximum file size  <br /> 
C) A system task  <br /> 
D) A system cron file  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) A time/date schedule
B) A maximum file size

## Explanation
For Sling log rotation configuration, the two correct controls are:

A) A time/date schedule
B) A maximum file size

Here's why:

1. A time/date schedule:
- Allows regular rotation intervals
- Can be set to specific times
- Predictable maintenance

2. A maximum file size:
- Prevents logs from growing too large
- Automatic rotation when size limit reached
- Space management

Why others are incorrect:
- C) System task: Not a Sling log rotation method
- D) System cron file: Not used for Sling logging

Sling log rotation typically uses:
```
Size-based rotation:
- Set maximum file size
- Rotate when size exceeded

Time-based rotation:
- Set schedule (daily/weekly)
- Rotate at specified times
```

These two methods (size and time) can work together to ensure proper log management.
