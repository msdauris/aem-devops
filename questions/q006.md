## Question
An html page is published and is accessible through the dispatcher. A client is trying to access the updated page but is not getting the updated content.
- A rule /type "allow" /glob "*.html" is present in the dispatcher /cache /rules configuration
- The HTTP header "Cache-Control: max-age=3600" is set for all requests with the html extension
- The /invalidate section is not set in the dispatcher configuration
- A flush agent is configured on the publish instance
- A CDN is serving all static content including html files and was flushed manually
Why does the content fail to update on the client side? choose one.

## Options
A) The content is still cached in the dispatcher after the CDN flush
B) The file was cached on the client side in the browser cache
C) The flush occurred before the content was replicated because there are a lot of items in the queue.
D) There is no /invalidate section present in the dispatcher configuration to invalidate the updated content.

## Correct Answer
The file was cached on the client side in the browser cache

## Explanation
The Cache-Control header explicitly tells browsers to cache for 1 hour
This would prevent checking for updates regardless of server-side status
It's the only condition that fully explains why the client can't see updates even after CDN flush
