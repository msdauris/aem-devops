## Question
A DevOps engineer is supporting a client on Adobe Managed Services. The setup will be migrated to AEM as a Cloud Service.
Which two methods can be applied for scaling publish instances on the current platform? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) Manual scaling via CSE horizontally  <br /> 
B) Auto scaling via Cloud Manager horizontally  <br /> 
C) Auto scaling via Cloud Manager vertically <br /> 
D) Manual scaling via the Adobe 1/0 CLI vertically  <br /> 
E) Manual scaling via Cloud Manager horizontally  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Auto scaling via Cloud Manager horizontally  <br /> 
E) Manual scaling via Cloud Manager horizontally  <br /> 

## Explanation
AMS supports both auto-scaling and manual scaling through Cloud Manager, and both use horizontal scaling. So the correct answers are:
✅ B) Auto scaling via Cloud Manager horizontally
✅ E) Manual scaling via Cloud Manager horizontally

❌ A) Manual scaling via CSE horizontally is incorrect because Cloud Manager handles manual scaling now, and CSEs no longer manage instance scaling directly.
