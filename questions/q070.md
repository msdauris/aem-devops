## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to analyze an end user performance issue for an AEM as a Cloud Service Sites setup. Certain assets that are delivered with a no-cache header to the browser are being delivered very slowly. Network performance looks fine, and other assets that have a TTL defined in the caching header are delivered normally.
Which log file should the DevOps engineer analyze further?

## Options
A) Dispatcher log  <br /> 
B) HAR file  <br /> 
C) AEM request log <br /> 
D) AEM error log  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) AEM request log 

## Explanation

## Notes
Yes, this is the key differentiator in the question! Let's break down what this tells us:

1. Assets WITH TTL (working fine):
- Gets cached in dispatcher
- Quick delivery
- Normal performance

2. Assets with NO-CACHE header (slow):
- Must go to publish every time
- Bypass dispatcher cache
- Slow delivery

Therefore AEM request log (C) is best because:
- Shows processing on publish instance
- These uncached requests MUST go to publish
- We can see why they're slow there

It's about understanding the comparison:
```
Fast assets: Browser â†” Dispatcher (cached)
vs
Slow assets: Browser â†’ Dispatcher â†’ Publish (where the slowdown is)
```

The fact that cached assets work fine but uncached ones don't points directly to a publish instance processing issue, which is exactly what the request log would show.

The **key insight** is that cached assets behave **normally**, while **uncached assets are slow**, meaning the **bottleneck is on the publish instance** rather than the network or dispatcher.  

By analyzing the **AEM request log**, a DevOps engineer can pinpoint:  
âœ… Slow request processing on the publish instance  
âœ… Potential performance issues with asset rendering or retrieval  
âœ… Possible optimizations (e.g., tuning the publish instance or improving asset delivery)  

This is a textbook example of **using process of elimination and comparison** to diagnose an issue effectively. Well done! ðŸ’¡ðŸ”¥
