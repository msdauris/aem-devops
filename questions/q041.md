## Question
The DevOps Engineer sees many occurrences of org.apache.sling.api.resource.LoginException in the logs.
Apache Sling Service User Mapper Service is configured with a default user.
Service user mapping is configured for the OSGi bundle, causing the exception.
What is the root cause of these exceptions?

## Options
A) Administrative resource resolvers have been disabled by configuration and the bundle deployed still relies on it  <br /> 
B) The configured service user is not a system user or does not exist <br />

## Notes
You're right - this is a tricky one without clear documentation to verify. Let's analyze why both could be right:

A) "Administrative resource resolvers have been disabled by configuration and the bundle deployed still relies on it"
- Could cause LoginException
- Common security hardening practice
- Bundle might be using deprecated admin resolvers

B) "The configured service user is not a system user or does not exist"
- Also could cause LoginException
- Makes sense given service user context
- Matches mapping exists but still fails

Without official Adobe documentation to confirm:
1. We can't be 100% certain
2. Both are plausible causes
3. Different exam sources conflict

Best approach:
1. Document both possibilities
2. Note this as a questionable exam item
3. Look for this scenario in practice
4. Continue searching for official documentation
