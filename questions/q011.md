A DevOps Engineer narrowed down the following long running requests:

Which step should be taken to resolve this issue?

## Options
A) Create new Lucene Index definitions to include OOTB and custom properties
B) Integrate SOLR Search Index with AEM
C) Modify the search component to use the new Core Components and leverage Index definitions
D) Use /allowedClients in dispatcher.any to cache requests with URL parameter q

## Correct Answer
[Letter of correct option]

## Explanation
Create new Lucene Index definitions:

Built into Oak (AEM's repository)
Defines what content properties are indexed
Can include both OOTB (out-of-the-box) and custom properties
Local to AEM instance
Good for standard implementations
Lower maintenance overhead

Integrate SOLR Search Index:

External search platform
More powerful/flexible than Lucene
Better for large-scale implementations
Requires additional infrastructure
More complex to maintain
Better performance for large datasets

Modify search component to use Core Components:

Uses AEM's modern component framework
Leverages existing index definitions
Front-end focused solution
Doesn't change underlying search infrastructure
More about presentation than search performance

Use /allowedClients in dispatcher.any:

This is incorrect approach
/allowedClients is for client IP filtering
Not related to search functionality
Won't help with search performance
Caching search requests with parameters isn't recommended

Key differences:

Lucene: Built-in, simpler, good for standard use
SOLR: External, powerful, better for large scale
Core Components: Front-end improvement only
/allowedClients: Wrong tool entirely, not for search
