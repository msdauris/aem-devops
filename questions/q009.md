## Question
How can a DevOps Engineer limit access to certain pages in the AEM Publish instance?

## Options
A) Use the security features of Adobe Drive  <br /> 
B) Use the AEM External Login Module  <br /> 
C) Use Closed User Groups (CUGs)  <br /> 
D) Use Access Control Lists for the authors  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Use Closed User Groups (CUGs)

## Explanation
Access Control Lists (ACLs) for authors

Basic permission management system in AEM  <br /> 
Controls what actions users/groups can perform on specific pages/nodes  <br /> 
Used for standard content authoring permissions  <br /> 
Most basic/common level of security control  <br /> 


Closed User Groups (CUGs)

Used to restrict access to specific pages in publish environment  <br /> 
Requires users to log in to view certain content  <br /> 
Commonly used for member-only sections of a website  <br /> 
Works at the page level rather than node level  <br /> 
Best for publish-side content restriction  <br /> 


AEM External Login Module

Allows integration with external authentication systems  <br /> 
Can connect to LDAP, SSO, or other enterprise authentication  <br /> 
Used when you need to authenticate against existing company systems  <br /> 
More enterprise-level solution  <br /> 


Adobe Drive security features

Adobe Drive is a deprecated feature  <br /> 
Was used for WebDAV integration  <br /> 
Not a current security solution for modern AEM  <br /> 
Should not be used in current implementations  <br />
