## Question
How can a DevOps Engineer limit access to certain pages in the AEM Publish instance?

## Options
A) Use the security features of Adobe Drive  <br /> 
B) Use the AEM External Login Module  <br /> 
C) Use Closed User Groups (CUGs)  <br /> 
D) Use Access Control Lists for the authors  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Use Closed User Groups (CUGs)

## Explanation
Access Control Lists (ACLs) for authors

Basic permission management system in AEM
Controls what actions users/groups can perform on specific pages/nodes
Used for standard content authoring permissions
Most basic/common level of security control


Closed User Groups (CUGs)

Used to restrict access to specific pages in publish environment
Requires users to log in to view certain content
Commonly used for member-only sections of a website
Works at the page level rather than node level
Best for publish-side content restriction


AEM External Login Module

Allows integration with external authentication systems
Can connect to LDAP, SSO, or other enterprise authentication
Used when you need to authenticate against existing company systems
More enterprise-level solution


Adobe Drive security features

Adobe Drive is a deprecated feature
Was used for WebDAV integration
Not a current security solution for modern AEM
Should not be used in current implementations
