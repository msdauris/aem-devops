## Question
During security tests, it becomes apparent that AEM-specific paths were accessible on the publish instance. These paths should not be accessible to the public.
Which configuration should be used on a publish dispatcher instance?

## Options
A) /0001 {/type "deny" /glob "*"}  <br /> 
B) /0001 {/type "deny" /url "/crx/*}  <br /> 
C) /0001 {/type "deny" /url "/system/*"}  <br /> 
D) /0001 {/type "deny" /glob "/system/*"}  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
Deny * (A)or url as in documentation

## Notes
Let's analyze each dispatcher filter configuration:

1. `/0001 {/type "deny" /glob "*"} (A)`
- Too broad
- Blocks everything
- Not selective enough
- Would break site functionality

2. `/0001 {/type "deny" /url "/crx/*"} (B)`
- Blocks CRX paths
- Uses /url (correct syntax)
- Not comprehensive enough
- Missing other system paths

3. `/0001 {/type "deny" /url "/system/*"} (C)`
- Blocks system paths
- Uses /url (correct syntax)
- Correct path to protect

4. `/0001 {/type "deny" /glob "/system/*"} (D)`
- Uses deprecated /glob
- Correct path but wrong syntax
- /glob is not recommended


Though note the syntax has an error (extra asterisk at end), but among given options, blocking /system/* with /url type is the best security practice.

Remember: Apache documentation recommends /url over /glob for security configurations.
