## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to configure a new program in an Adobe Managed Services instance. 
- The customer expects consistent traffic of approximately 10,000 page views per minute on the Production CDN with a caching ratio of 95%. - The Production environment will have 4 dispatcher/publish servers. 
- The Staging environment will have 1 dispatcher/publish server.
How should the DevOps engineer configure the new program?

## Options
A) Set the "95th percentile response time" KPI to the recommended value of 3 seconds and the"Page Views per Minute"
KPI to 9,500.  <br /> 
B) Enable the On-demand scaling policy for the Non-Production Environment and set "Maxadditional Publish-Dispatcher segments allowed" to 1. <br /> 
C) Enable the On-demand scaling policy for the Non-Production Environment and set "Maxadditional Publish-Dispatcher segments allowed" to 3.  <br /> 
D) Set the "95th percentile response time" KPI to the recommended value of 3 seconds and the "Page Views per Minute"
KPI to 2,500.  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
D) Set the "95th percentile response time" KPI to the recommended value of 3 seconds and the "Page Views per Minute"
KPI to 2,500.

## Explanation
- Total page views: 10,000 per minute
- Cache hit ratio: 95%
- Requests reaching AEM (uncached requests):500 requests/minute (10,000×(1−0.95)=500 requests/minute)- Since only uncached requests hit AEM, the Page Views per Minute KPI should be set to 500, not 9,500.

## Notes
Performance KPIs (A,D)    vs    Scaling Policies (B,C)
- Response time targets        - Auto-scaling limits
- Traffic expectations        - Resource management
- Static thresholds          - Dynamic adjustment

Production:
- 10,000 page views/minute
- 95% cache ratio
- 4 dispatcher/publish pairs

Staging:
- 1 dispatcher/publish pair

The 2,500 page views/minute makes sense because:

With 95% cache ratio, only 5% hits backend
10,000 * 0.05 = 500 actual hits per minute per server
With 4 servers = 2,000 total backend hits
2,500 provides buffer for spikes


3 seconds for 95th percentile is standard recommendation

Other options are incorrect:

A) 9,500 views too high for backend traffic
B,C) On-demand scaling not relevant for AMS setup with fixed server count
