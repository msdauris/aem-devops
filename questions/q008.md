## Question
Assuming the project was generated using the AEM maven archetype, which maven command triggers the build and deployment of a content-package to a publish instance?

## Options
A) mvn install -PautolnstallPackagePublish
B) mvn install -PautolnstallBundle
C) mvn install -PautolnstallPackage
D) mvn install deploy -Pmode=autolnstallPackage

## Correct Answer
A) mvn install -PautolnstallPackagePublish

## Explanation
mvn install -PautolnstallPackagePublish

Builds AND installs the package to the publisher instance
The -P flag activates a profile named "autoInstallPackagePublish"
Used when you want to directly deploy to publish server

mvn install -PautolnstallBundle

Installs ONLY the OSGi bundles
Doesn't deploy any content packages
Used for just deploying Java code changes
Common during bundle development

mvn install -PautolnstallPackage

Builds and installs the package to the author instance
Most commonly used development command
Deploys content packages to author instance
Includes both code and content


mvn install deploy -Pmode=autolnstallPackage

This syntax looks incorrect
Should be -P not -Pmode=
Would likely fail to execute properly
