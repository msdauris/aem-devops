## Question
How can the DevOps Engineer prevent any user from logging in with the default admin credentials during startup of the AEM instance?

## Options
A) Change the default AEM admin password on initial setup  <br /> 
B) Disable the OSGi web console login bundle by using the production ready runmode  <br /> 
C) Configure the dispatcher to prevent access to /system/console  <br /> 
D) Update the default password in the OSGi configuration for the OSGi web console  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Change the default AEM admin password on initial setup

## Explanation
Let's explain why A is correct:

Addresses root issue of default credentials
Changes password DURING startup
Prevents any initial access with default password
Most secure approach

Why others don't solve the problem:

B) Disabling OSGi console doesn't prevent admin login
C) Dispatcher config doesn't affect initial setup
D) OSGi console password doesn't change admin credentials

This can be done by:

Using system property: -Dadmin.password.reset=true
Setting new password at first startup
Before anyone can access the system

This ensures no one can ever log in with the default admin/admin credentials.
