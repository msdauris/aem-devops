## Question
A form POST functions correctly on publish and dispatch servers but does not function on an author server. The form is a standard form POST with no JavaScript dependency.
The developer confirms the same behavior using the "?2wcmmode=disabled" parameter as well as using browser
incognito mode.
Which two items should the DevOps engineer research? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) Adobe Granite CSRF Filter  <br /> 
B) Adobe WCM Debug Filter  <br /> 
C) Adobe HTML Library Manager  <br /> 
D) Apache Sling Referrer Filter  <br /> 
E) Adobe Sling Request Parameter Handling <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Adobe Granite CSRF Filter <br />
D) Apache Sling Referrer Filter <br />

## Explanation
The two most relevant answers would be:
A) Adobe Granite CSRF Filter
D) Apache Sling Referrer Filter
Here's why these two security filters matter:

CSRF Filter:

Active by default on author
Requires CSRF tokens for POST requests
More restrictive on author instance
Common cause of form POST failures


Referrer Filter:

Checks origin of requests
More strict on author
Can block POST requests
Security measure for author instance

Other options aren't as relevant:

B) Debug Filter: Wouldn't block POSTs
C) HTML Library Manager: Handles CSS/JS, not forms
D) Parameter Handling: Would affect all instances equally
