## Question
A server has been provisioned with 32GB, 16 cores, and 1TB for use as an author instance to host AEM Assets.
Which operation should the DevOps engineer perform before starting AEM?

## Options
A) Set COFILE_SIZE_LIMIT to 1TB <br /> 
B) Set CQJVM_OPTS - Xmx to 32gb  <br /> 
C) Set CQJVM_OPTS -Xmx to 16gb  <br /> 
D) Set CQJVM_OPTS -XX:MaxPermSize to 16gb  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) Set CQJVM_OPTS -Xmx to 16gb 

## Explanation
Given these server specs:
- 32GB RAM
- 16 cores
- 1TB storage
- For AEM Assets author instance

The correct answer is C) Set CQJVM_OPTS -Xmx to 16gb because:

1. JVM Heap Size Best Practices:
- Should be about 50% of available RAM
- 32GB total â†’ 16GB heap is optimal
- Leaves room for OS and other processes
- Good for Assets workload

2. Why other options are wrong:
- A) COFILE_SIZE_LIMIT: Not valid parameter
- B) 32gb heap: Too large, would leave no memory for OS
- D) MaxPermSize: Deprecated in modern Java

The 16GB heap setting (-Xmx16g) is:
- Appropriate for 32GB machine
- Suitable for Assets workload
- Following AEM sizing guidelines
- Leaves adequate system resources

## Notes
COFILE_SIZE_LIMIT to 1TB (A)

- Not a valid AEM parameter
- Incorrect syntax
- Not a standard configuration


CQJVM_OPTS -Xmx to 32gb (B)

- Maximum heap size setting
- Too large for most systems
- Unrealistic value
- Could cause system issues


CQJVM_OPTS -Xmx to 16gb (C)

- Maximum heap size setting
- More reasonable value
- Common in production
- Standard configuration


CQJVM_OPTS -XX:MaxPermSize to 16gb (D)

- Deprecated parameter
- Not used in modern Java
- Replaced by MetaspaceSize
- Outdated configuration
