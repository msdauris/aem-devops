## Question
An enterprise customer of AEM as a Cloud Service has three independent development teams. Each team is responsible for publishing a different website with a unique domain and SSL certificate to the single, shared AEM program.
- Each team has set their own project timeline with a different launch date planned within the next 6 months.
- Each team has their own upstream Git repository hosted in the corporate subnet, which they initialized using the latest aem-project-archetype.
- The DevOps engineer is solely responsible for any configurations needed to enable automated deployment to all three environments (dev, stage, and prod).
Which two options should the DevOps engineer choose? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) Use Git submodules in Cloud Manager to merge the content of multiple branches across git repositories at build time <br /> 
B) Three separate Cloud Service programs and Cloud Manager Developer/Deployment Manager role assignments for each of the three team leads  <br /> 
C) A multi-module Maven project that embeds each team's Git repository as a module of the encompassing Maven
project  <br /> 
D) A fourth Git repository that contains a root pom file and a CI/CD pipeline script cloning the other three project repositories as subfolders  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) A multi-module Maven project that embeds each team's Git repository as a module of the encompassing Maven
project  <br /> 
D) A fourth Git repository that contains a root pom file and a CI/CD pipeline script cloning the other three project repositories as subfolders  <br />

## Notes
For this multi-team, single AEM program scenario, the correct answers would be:

C) A multi-module Maven project that embeds each team's Git repository as a module of the encompassing Maven project

AND

D) A fourth Git repository that contains a root pom file and a CI/CD pipeline script cloning the other three project repositories as subfolders

Why these are correct:
1. Both solutions allow:
   - Integration of multiple team repositories
   - Single build process
   - Maintaining team independence
   - Working within single program constraint

2. Why the others are incorrect:
   - A) Git submodules aren't supported in Cloud Manager
   - B) Can't have separate programs (requirement states single shared program)

   Why NOT the other options?
❌ A) Use Git submodules in Cloud Manager

Cloud Manager does not support Git submodules at build time.
Git submodules can introduce complex merge and dependency management issues.
❌ B) Three separate Cloud Service programs

The question states that there is a single shared AEM program, so separate programs are not an option.
Separate Cloud Manager roles would not help, as there is only one shared Cloud Manager deployment pipeline.

The solution needs to:
```
- Maintain separate team repositories
- Enable single deployment pipeline
- Allow different launch times
- Support separate SSL certificates
- Work within Cloud Manager limitations
```

Both C and D provide ways to aggregate multiple repositories into a single deployable unit while maintaining team independence.
