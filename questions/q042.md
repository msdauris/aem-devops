## Question
A DevOps Engineer receives notifications from the monitoring system about a bundle being stuck in "installed" state.
- A new version of an OSGi bundle was recently deployed.
- All author and publish instances are affected.
- Manually starting the bundle does not solve the issue.
What prevents the OSGi bundle from being activated?

## Options
A) At least one OSGi bundle marked as a dependency is not available in the instances.  <br /> 
B) At least one OSGi component throws an exception during activation  <br /> 
C) At least one OSGi component has ConfigurationPolicy set to "required" and no configuration is provided. <br /> 
D) At least one OSGi component reference is unsatisfied. <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) At least one OSGi bundle marked as a dependency is not available in the instances.

## Explanation
The correct answer is A) "At least one OSGi bundle marked as a dependency is not available in the instances" because:

Bundle States:

Installed = Bundle loaded but can't resolve dependencies
Resolved = Dependencies found, ready to start
Active = Running


Why dependency issue (A):

"Installed" state specifically indicates dependency resolution failure
Bundle can't move to "Resolved" state
Missing dependency prevents state transition
Explains why manual start fails


Why others are incorrect:

B) Component exceptions: Would show different state
C) Missing configuration: Bundle would still resolve
D) Unsatisfied references: Would reach "Resolved" state

The bundle remains in "installed" state because it can't resolve its dependencies, preventing it from moving to "resolved" and then "active" states.
