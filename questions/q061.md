## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to deploy a filevault package that contains a mixture of mutable and immutable paths to AEM as a Cloud Service, via Package Manager.
What should the DevOps engineer do?

## Options
A) Refactor the content package, set the packageType to "content", and make sure it contains all subpackages and OSGi configurations <br /> 
B) Refactor the content package, set the packageType to "content", and set the inclusion filters to only /content or /conf  <br /> 
C) Refactor the content package, set the packageType to "mixed", and leave the filter.ml unchanged  <br /> 
D) Refactor the content package, set the packageType to "mixed", and make sure it contains allsubpackages and OSGi configurations  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
B) Refactor the content package, set the packageType to "content", and set the inclusion filters to only /content or /conf  <br />

## Notes
Let's analyze these different package configuration approaches:

1. **Package Type "content" with everything (A)**
- Type: content
- Includes: subpackages and OSGi configs
- Incorrect mix - content type shouldn't have OSGi

2. **Package Type "content" with proper filters (B)**
- Type: content
- Only /content or /conf paths
- Follows best practices
- Correct content separation

3. **Package Type "mixed" unchanged (C)**
- Type: mixed
- No filter changes
- Doesn't improve situation
- No proper separation

4. **Package Type "mixed" with everything (D)**
- Type: mixed
- Includes subpackages and OSGi
- No proper separation
- Not following best practices

Best practices differences:
```
Content Package:           vs    Mixed Package:
- Only content paths           - Any content type
- No code/config              - Less structured
- Clean separation            - More flexible
- Best practice              - Not recommended
```

B is typically best practice because it:
- Uses correct package type
- Has proper content filtering
- Follows separation of concerns
- Maintains clean structure
