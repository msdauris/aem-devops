## Question
What is the role of the External Login Module when setting up LDAP Authentication with AEM?

## Options
A) It defines how the Identity Provider users and groups will be synchronized with the repository.  <br /> 
B) It invokes JMX syncing of users.  <br /> 
C) It defines which Identity Provider and Sync Handler to use.  <br /> 
D) It defines how users are retrieved from the LDAP server. <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) It defines which Identity Provider and Sync Handler to use. 

## Explanation
C) It defines which Identity Provider and Sync Handler to use is correct.

The External Login Module acts as a connector, specifying:
- Which Identity Provider to use
- Which Sync Handler to use for user/group synchronization

Other options are incorrect:
- A) Describes Sync Handler role, not Login Module
- B) JMX syncing isn't related to Login Module
- D) Describes LDAP Provider role, not Login Module

The Login Module connects the components but doesn't handle synchronization or user retrieval directly.
