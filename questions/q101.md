## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to install a package to a remote AEM staging system using continuous deployment. Which two tools and methods should the DevOps engineer use? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) make file with aem-deploy plugin <br /> 
B) apache ant aem-deploy plugin  <br /> 
C) content package maven plugin <br /> 
D) curl based script with package manager REST API  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) content package maven plugin <br /> 
D) curl based script with package manager REST API  <br /> 

## Explanation
The **two best options** for installing a package to a remote AEM staging system using continuous deployment are:

### ‚úÖ **Correct Answers:**  
1. **C) Content Package Maven Plugin**  
   - The **Content Package Maven Plugin** is widely used in **CI/CD pipelines** for deploying packages to **AEM** environments.  
   - It integrates well with **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD**, etc.  
   - It automates the **package installation** and can be easily configured in a **Maven-based project**.  
   - Example Maven command:  
     ```sh
     mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
     ```

2. **D) Curl-based script with Package Manager REST API**  
   - **AEM Package Manager REST API** allows for **remote installation** of content packages.  
   - **cURL** is a simple and effective method for **deploying packages via API calls**.  
   - This is useful for **script-based automation** in CI/CD pipelines.  
   - Example cURL command:
     ```sh
     curl -u admin:admin -F file=@my-package.zip \
          -F name=my-package -F force=true \
          http://aem-host:4502/crx/packmgr/service/.json/?cmd=install
     ```

### ‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- **A) Makefile with aem-deploy plugin**  
  - There is **no widely known `aem-deploy` plugin** for Makefile.  
  - **Makefiles** are not commonly used in **AEM deployment workflows**.  

- **B) Apache Ant aem-deploy plugin**  
  - **Apache Ant** is an older build tool, but **it is not commonly used** for AEM **package deployment**.  
  - AEM's **recommended tools** are **Maven** and **REST API-based scripts**.

### **Final Answer:** ‚úÖ **C and D**  
These methods align with modern DevOps practices and AEM's recommended deployment strategies. üöÄ

## Notes
For automating package deployment to remote AEM staging system, the correct answers are:

C) content package maven plugin
D) curl based script with package manager REST API

Why these are correct:

1. Content Package Maven Plugin:
- Standard tool for AEM deployment
- Integrates with CI/CD
- Handles package management
- Industry standard approach

2. Curl with Package Manager REST API:
- Flexible scripting option
- Direct interaction with AEM
- Can be automated
- Works with any CI system

Why others aren't suitable:
- A) make file with aem-deploy plugin: Not a standard tool
- B) apache ant aem-deploy plugin: Outdated approach

Both solutions provide:
```
- Remote deployment capability
- Automation support
- Integration with CI/CD
- Package management
```

Maven plugin is more structured while curl offers flexibility when needed.
