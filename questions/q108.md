## Question
DevOps engineer is configuring a non-production deployment pipeline. The code quality is checked in the build pipeline.
A security check is configured in the deployment pipeline to identify any major security issues before a production deployment.
Which other check should be executed before deployment to production

## Options
A) An OSGi configuration validity check for the new release  <br /> 
B) A dispatcher invalidation rule check for replication functionality<br /> 
C) A sling models validation check for the new release <br /> 
D) A performance check for the actual release functionality  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
D) A performance check for the actual release functionality  <br /> 

## Explanation
D) A performance check for the actual release functionality is correct.

Let's analyze the pipeline setup:

Already have:
1. Code quality check (in build pipeline)
2. Security check (in deployment pipeline)

Missing:
- Performance validation before production

Why performance check (D) is crucial:
- Validates actual runtime behavior
- Catches performance regressions
- Tests under real conditions
- Essential before production release

Why others aren't as critical:
- A) OSGi config: More basic validation
- B) Dispatcher rules: Narrower scope
- C) Sling models: Already covered by code quality

Deployment Pipeline Best Practice:
```
Build Pipeline:         Deployment Pipeline:
- Code quality         - Security checks
- Unit tests           - Performance checks ‚Üê Missing
- Compilation         - Integration tests
```

Performance check is the key missing component before production deployment.
