## Question
A DevOps engineer needs to deploy a branch to the Stage Environment, so UAT testing can begin. The engineer starts a Production Pipeline with a manual trigger. The Code Scanning results return the following summary:
- Security Rating: C
- Reliability Rating: B
- Maintainability Rating: A
- Code Coverage: 10%
Which two actions should the DevOps engineer take? (Choose two.)

## Options
A) Request the developer to resolve Code Coverage issues  <br /> 
B) Request the developer to resolve Security Rating issues  <br /> 
C) Override this build step and proceed with deployment  <br /> 
D) Start a new Deployment Pipeline with manual override  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Request the developer to resolve Code Coverage issues  <br /> 
B) Request the developer to resolve Security Rating issues  <br /> 

## Explanation
The Production Pipeline includes Code Scanning as a quality gate before deployment. The results indicate:

Security Rating: C (Indicates potential vulnerabilities üõë)
Code Coverage: 10% (Very low, may impact software reliability ‚ùó)
To ensure a stable and secure UAT testing environment, the DevOps engineer should:

(A) Request the developer to improve Code Coverage

Code Coverage at 10% is too low‚Äîbest practice requires at least 60-80%.
Low coverage means tests are insufficient, increasing the risk of undetected bugs.
(B) Request the developer to fix Security Rating issues

Security Rating of C indicates vulnerabilities that might block deployment or introduce risks in production.
Security issues should be fixed before proceeding, especially for staging and production.

Why NOT the Other Options?
‚ùå C) Override this build step and proceed with deployment

Risky decision‚Äîignoring security & test coverage can lead to bugs, regressions, and security breaches.
UAT should not be used for untested or insecure code.
‚ùå D) Start a new Deployment Pipeline with manual override

Not necessary‚Äîa new pipeline run will not fix the low Code Coverage or security issues.
The priority is fixing the issues, not bypassing them.
