## Question
A DevOps engineer receives a blank page in the browser while the log file prints "No renderer for extension htm!".
What is a potential cause of this issue?

## Options
A) The content path is not configured to deliver HTML renderings <br /> 
B) The apache dispatcher does not send the correct format header  <br /> 
C) The path for the resource type as declared by the content node does not exist  <br /> 
D) The resource super type declaration is missing on the content node  <br /> 

## Correct Answer
C) The path for the resource type as declared by the content node does not exist 

## Explanation
The correct answer is:  

✅ **C) The path for the resource type as declared by the content node does not exist**  

### **Explanation:**  
- The error **"No renderer for extension htm!"** indicates that **AEM does not know how to render the requested resource**.  
- This typically happens when the **resource type assigned to the content node does not have a corresponding rendering script (HTL, JSP, or servlet)**.  
- If the **resource type path is incorrect or missing**, AEM cannot resolve the rendering logic, leading to this error.  

### **Why Not the Other Options?**  
❌ **A) The content path is not configured to deliver HTML renderings**  
- Incorrect, because AEM generally defaults to rendering HTML unless specifically blocked or misconfigured.  

❌ **B) The Apache Dispatcher does not send the correct format header**  
- Incorrect, because the Dispatcher mainly manages caching and request forwarding—it does not control renderers within AEM.  

❌ **D) The resource super type declaration is missing on the content node**  
- While a missing **sling:resourceSuperType** can cause rendering issues, it wouldn't specifically trigger the **"No renderer for extension htm!"** error. That error suggests **the declared resource type itself does not exist or lacks a rendering script**.  

### **Final Answer: C** ✅
