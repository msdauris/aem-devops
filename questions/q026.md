## Question
In what two ways can a DevOps Engineer install a content package?

## Options
A) Store the content package in the crx-quickstart/install folder in the filesystem <br /> 
B) Use CRX Package Manager <br /> 
C) Upload the package through the OSGi console <br /> 
D) Upload the package to /content/dam and start the InstallPackageWorkflow  <br /> 
E) Store the content package in the cry-quickstart/app folder in the filesystemC. Use CRX Package Manager <br /> 

## Correct Answer
A) Store the content package in the crx-quickstart/install folder in the filesystem <br /> 
B) Use CRX Package Manager <br /> 

## Explanation
Let me break down each method of content package installation:

1. **Store in crx-quickstart/install folder (A)**
- Valid method
- Hot folder deployment
- System scans and installs automatically
- Works for packages and bundles
- Good for automated deployments

2. **Use CRX Package Manager (B)**
- Standard UI-based method
- Most common approach
- Manual upload and install
- Provides installation feedback
- Can validate before installing

3. **Upload through OSGi console (C)**
- Not a valid method
- OSGi console is for bundles only
- Can't install content packages this way
- Incorrect approach

4. **Upload to /content/dam and InstallPackageWorkflow (D)**
- Not a valid method
- No such workflow exists
- DAM isn't for package installation
- Incorrect approach

5. **Store in crx-quickstart/app folder (E)**
- Not a valid location
- This folder doesn't exist
- Incorrect path
- Not a valid installation method

Valid methods comparison:
```
crx-quickstart/install (A)  |  Package Manager (B)
---------------------------|----------------------
Automated                  |  Manual
No feedback               |  Shows progress
File system access needed |  UI access needed
Good for automation      |  Good for manual install
```

Only A and B are valid methods.
