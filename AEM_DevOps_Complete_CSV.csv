Question ID,Topic,Question Type,Difficulty,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation,Study Notes
Q1,CRX/Oak,Flashcard,Easy,"What tool must be used to run the offline compaction?","oak-run jar","AEM Web Console","CRXDE Lite","Package Manager","A","The oak-run jar tool is specifically designed for offline repository maintenance operations including compaction. It provides low-level access to the Oak repository for operations that cannot be performed while AEM is running.","Memorize: oak-run jar for offline compaction"
Q2,Maintenance,Flashcard,Medium,"A DevOps engineer configures a delay in the out-of-the-box online backup. What is the result of a delay that is too large?","Excessive reads of the repository occur","The backup takes more than 24 hours","The backup fails immediately","Repository performance improves","B","When using a very large delay in online backup configuration, the backup process becomes extremely slow. Adobe recommends that online backups should not take more than 24 hours, as backups exceeding this timeframe may not contain all binaries and should be discarded.","Key fact: Online backups should not exceed 24 hours"
Q3,Deployment,Practice Question,Medium,"A DevOps engineer needs to perform offline maintenance on a publish instance. Which step should the DevOps engineer take regarding replication of content?","Pause the replication queue to allow items to queue","Disable the replication agent for the publish instance","Deactivate the replication agent","Delete the replication agent","B","When performing offline maintenance on a publish instance, the replication agent should be disabled to prevent replication attempts to an unavailable target. This prevents replication failures and queue buildup during maintenance windows.","Think: Prevent replication to unavailable target"
Q4,CRX/Oak,INVALID,INVALID,"A DevOps engineer needs to change the default size for a tar file to 512MB. Which option should be used to enable this configuration?","Set changeSize property to 512 in DocumentNodeStoreService.config","Set tarmk.size property to 512 in SegmentNodeStoreService.config","Set Segment cache size property to 512 in Oak Segment TAR NodeStore Service","Set NodeState cache property to 512 in Document NodeStore Service","INVALID","This question is invalid because the maximum tar file size in Oak is 256MB and cannot be increased to 512MB. The question tests knowledge of a configuration that doesn't exist in practice.","REMOVE: This question tests non-existent functionality"
Q5,Deployment,Practice Question,Medium,"A DevOps engineer notices that existing pages are not updated through package installation. The updated pages are present after deleting the pages that are not updating and reinstalling the package. What is the source of the problem?","Update mode is set","Install mode is set","Merge mode is set","Replace mode is set","C","When merge mode is set, existing content is not modified - only new content is added and none is deleted or modified. This prevents updates to existing pages, which is why deleting and reinstalling works (it removes the old content first).","Key concept: Merge mode prevents updates to existing content"
Q6,Dispatcher,Practice Question,Hard,"An HTML page is published and accessible through the dispatcher. A client is trying to access the updated page but is not getting the updated content. Given: Cache-Control: max-age=3600 header is set for HTML requests. Why does the content fail to update on the client side?","The content is still cached in the dispatcher after the CDN flush","The file was cached on the client side in the browser cache","The flush occurred before content was replicated due to queue backlog","There is no /invalidate section to invalidate updated content","B","The Cache-Control: max-age=3600 header explicitly tells browsers to cache the content for 1 hour (3600 seconds). This prevents the browser from checking for updates regardless of server-side cache status, which is why the client cannot see updates even after CDN flush.","Critical: Browser cache headers override server-side cache management"
Q7,Security,Practice Question,Medium,"During security tests, AEM-specific paths were accessible on the publish instance that should not be accessible to the public. What is the best practice configuration on a publish dispatcher instance?","/0001 {/type ""deny"" /url ""/system/*""}","/0001 {/type ""deny"" /url ""/crx/*""}","/0001 {/type ""deny"" /glob ""/system/*""}","/0001 {/type ""deny"" /glob ""*""}","D","The best practice is to deny everything first with /0001 {/type ""deny"" /glob ""*""} and then explicitly allow only the content that should be publicly accessible. This follows the principle of ""deny by default, allow by exception"" for maximum security.","Security principle: Deny by default, allow by exception"

(Choose two.)","Offline start","On Git changes","Scheduled start","Data store changes","B and C","Git changes trigger automated builds when code is committed to the repository, while scheduled starts allow for time-based triggers for regular maintenance builds. These are the two most common automated trigger types for CI/CD pipelines.","CI/CD triggers: Git changes and scheduled starts"
Q14,Performance,Practice Question,Medium,"An end user reports performance issues on the site. The AEM environment uses a CDN and dispatcher as caching layers, and the number of requests on the publish instance has increased significantly. Which metric can be monitored to see trends related to the problem early enough to react?","""Current cache hit ratio"" in the dispatcher.log","Offload metric in the CDN","""Recent requests"" in AEM","Output from the request.log measuring response time","A","The cache hit ratio is an early warning indicator that shows caching effectiveness. A decreasing cache hit ratio indicates that more requests are bypassing the cache and hitting the publish instance, which precedes performance issues.","Monitoring concept: Cache hit ratio as early warning indicator"
Q15,Maintenance,Flashcard,Easy,"How often is a full online compaction (revision cleanup) run by default?","Every month","Every week","Every 2 weeks","Every 2 months","Once per day","According to Adobe documentation, full online compaction runs once per day by default. This is configured in the Operations Dashboard and is essential for maintaining repository health and performance.","Memorize: Online compaction runs once per day by default"
Q16,Security,Practice Question,Medium,"A client is submitting a form that contains a CSRF token passed using the CSRF-Token HTTP header. The header is visible in web server access logs but not present in the AEM instance request. What should the DevOps Engineer configure to make the values available on the AEM instance?","Add /clientheaders { ""CSRF-Token"" } in the dispatcher configuration","Add X-Forwarded-Header: CSRF-Token in the virtual host configuration","Add Header set CSRF-Token in the virtual host configuration","Add /filter /0001{/type ""allow"" /glob ""CSRF-Token""} in the dispatcher configuration","A","The /clientheaders section in dispatcher.any explicitly tells the dispatcher to forward specific headers to AEM. Adding ""CSRF-Token"" to this section will make the CSRF token available in AEM requests.","Dispatcher config: /clientheaders forwards headers to AEM"
Q17,Cloud Service,Practice Question,Medium,"A DevOps engineer is migrating an AEM 6.2 instance with a large content repository to AEM as a Cloud Service. The DevOps engineer must prepare the instance to move existing content via the Content Transfer Tool. Which two actions is the DevOps engineer required to perform? (Choose two.)","Refactor the application code","Upgrade the instance to AEM 6.5","Review total index size","Install the latest AEM Service Packs","B and C","The Content Transfer Tool requires a minimum of AEM 6.5, so upgrading from 6.2 is mandatory. Reviewing the total index size is also required because Cloud Service uses a different indexing approach, and index size affects migration planning.","Migration requirements: AEM 6.5 minimum and index size review"
Q18,OSGi,Practice Question,Hard,"A page cannot be rendered (HTTP response 500). The log file shows a NullPointerException. The source code points to a missing OSGi service ""NavigationService"" that uses @Reference to inject this service. What are four possible causes of this issue? (Choose four.)","The bundle containing the NavigationService implementation is in state INSTALLED","The bundle containing the NavigationService implementation is in state ACTIVE","The bundle containing the NavigationService implementation is in state RESOLVED","The implementation of the SCR component has unsatisfied references","The bundle shows different versions in ""Bundle Location"" compared to ""Version"" in Felix Console","The interface NavigationService and implementation reside in different bundles","The @Reference annotation was invalidly used in a class that is not an SCR component","There is more than one implementation of NavigationService active in the system","A, D, F, G","INSTALLED state means the bundle cannot provide services (dependencies not resolved). Unsatisfied references prevent the component from activating. Interface and implementation in different bundles can cause version mismatches. @Reference only works in proper SCR components; invalid usage prevents service injection.","OSGi troubleshooting: Bundle states, unsatisfied references, component setup"
Q19,CI/CD,Practice Question,Medium,"A DevOps Engineer is configuring a non-production deployment pipeline. Code quality is checked in the build pipeline. A security check is configured in the deployment pipeline to identify major security issues before production deployment.

This is the recommended approach for managing different configurations across environments.","Best practice: Use runmode folders for environment-specific OSGi configs"
Q21,Performance,Practice Question,Medium,"A production AEM instance shuts down randomly. Which JVM parameter should the DevOps engineer implement to make sure the correct debugging info is collected?","Use -agentlibjdwp JVM parameter","Use -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize JVM parameter","Use -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError JVM parameter","Use -XX:+PrintGCDetails JVM parameter","C","The -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError parameter creates a heap dump when OutOfMemoryError occurs, captures memory state when crash occurs, helps diagnose random shutdowns, and preserves debugging information for post-mortem analysis.","JVM debugging: -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError for crash analysis"
Q22,Performance,Practice Question,Easy,"A DevOps engineer needs to analyze response performance from AEM. Log files can be extracted from the AEM environment. Which logfile should be analyzed?","request.log","access.log","response.log","replication.log","A","The request.log captures details of each request made to AEM, records response times to help diagnose slow responses, and provides insight into processing delays, request load, and bottlenecks. This makes it the most relevant log file for analyzing response performance.","Performance analysis: request.log for response time analysis"
Q23,Dispatcher,Practice Question,Medium,"Which HTTP header should be used to flush a particular resource such as JSON data without invalidating the other parts of cache?","CQ-Handle: ResourceOnly","CQ-Action: Resource","CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly","CQ-Action-Scope: Resource","C","The CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly header replicates only the specific resource without including children or subnodes. This provides more targeted replication and is commonly used for single page or asset activation without affecting other cached content.","Dispatcher header: CQ-Action-Scope: ResourceOnly for targeted cache invalidation"
Q24,Deployment,Practice Question,Medium,"A DevOps Engineer has cloned an environment, and configurations must be adjusted for the environment to function correctly. Due to the cloning, the domain and IPs changed during the process. Specifically for content activation, which two parts of the configurations must be altered? (Choose two.)","The transport URI of the dispatcher configuration","The transport URI of the replication agents","The user of the flush agents","The user of the static content agent","The transport URI of the flush agents","B and E","After cloning, the replication agent URI must be updated to point to the new publish server, and the flush agent URI must be updated to point to the new dispatcher server. These are essential for content activation to work properly in the cloned environment.","Environment cloning: Update replication and flush agent URIs"
Q25,Performance,Practice Question,Hard,"Recently published content is not visible on the search results on the public website. All results show on the author environment, some results show on the publish environment, the LastindexedTime metric is not updated when checking the Async Indexer stats MBean, and the user is trying to find the page by the title. How can the DevOps Engineer gather more information about the root cause of this issue?","Increase the logging level for stderr.log to DEBUG by setting a JVM option","Increase the logging level for stdout.log to DEBUG in the sling log support configuration","Increase the logging level for the health reports in the maintenance UI","Increase the logging level for org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index","D","Since the issue is specifically related to indexing (LastindexedTime not updated, reindexing messages in logs), increasing the logging level for org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index will provide detailed information about Oak index operations, helping to identify why the indexing process is not working correctly.","Indexing troubleshooting: Enable Oak index logging for detailed diagnostics"
